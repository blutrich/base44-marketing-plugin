Reddit should transition to be under the Community, not Social Media
High volume of posts is due to Q&A, troubleshooting, builder discussions
Comment volume is due to peer-to-peer help
This audience needs support and enablement, not just content.

Content Calendar:	


Freelance social video editor:Currently I’m the content creator, videographer, editor, community manager, writer and strategist. While sustainable short-term, this approach limits us:
1-2 videos weekly when algorithms favor daily video content
Hours spent editing instead of engaging with our community or planning campaigns
Quality vs. speed trade-offs that impact our professional positioning

Part-Time Social Support Specialist As our social presence grows, so does the volume of comments, DMs, and support questions. Right now we’re getting:
127 DMs on meta and LI / week
216 comments on meta and LI (excluding ads, reddit and X)/ week
I'm spending 40% of my time on reactive support vs. strategic engagement and content creation
