ofer: (2:03) : Hi. Hey, Sunny. How are   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (2:04) : you? I'm good. I'm good. How   
ofer: (2:06) : are you doing? Nice nice to   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (2:08) : meet you. Nice to meet you too. I hear that you are the magician who is going   
ofer: (2:13) : to help   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (2:14) : make apps for us.   
ofer: (2:17) : Hopefully.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (2:20) : Hopefully.   
ofer: (2:21) : Amazing. Yeah. Nice to meet you. I'm on the research quest now to understand, you know, how things are working. And yeah, how did how did data flow and one   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (2:35) : of   
ofer: (2:35) : the most,   
ofer: (2:37) : one of the most important, thing for, Shay was that, the feature release.   
ofer: (2:44) : Will will get content much   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (2:46) : faster.   
ofer: (2:47) : Yeah. So I'm kinda trying to understand how everybody doing it. What's the workflows? Yeah. Where you're getting where you get information from?   
ofer: (2:58) : Sure.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (2:59) : No problem.   
ofer: (2:59) : Uh-huh.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (2:59) : So   
ofer: (3:00) : you get how do you gather information?   
ofer: (3:04) : Before release?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:05) : Got it. So right now, my current source of truth is this product sync   
ofer: (3:12) : app.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:14) : That the product team created. They I'm sure you've seen this. Around, but they basically   
ofer: (3:18) : give   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:18) : me, like, a brief summary of the different features that they're   
ofer: (3:21) : working   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:22) : on. And then they also include a calendar with an estimate of when they think this feature will   
ofer: (3:27) : launch. The   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:29) : problem one of the main problems is that,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:34) : the timing is not the best, like and and they admit this too. They   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:40) : the the estimate is a is a   
ofer: (3:41) : guess.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:42) : It's a   
ofer: (3:42) : guess.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:42) : Sometimes so sometimes it launch earlier when they're ready, and sometimes it launches much later. So it's very hard to plan things.   
ofer: (3:50) : For   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (3:50) : example, this week was supposed to have been a big launch week for multiple things. What ended up happening was it's now pushed to next week. So now next week looks a little bit crazy.   
ofer: (3:59) : Mhmm.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (4:00) : So, generally, what happens is every Monday, there is a meeting where the product team shares with the whole company the features that they're working on. Following that meeting, there is a more private meeting for the product marketing managers. So that we get more details about some of the   
ofer: (4:16) : specific   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (4:16) : apps. We   
ofer: (4:17) : we have the product? Like, the the next meeting is with the product?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (4:21) : And   
ofer: (4:22) : the product   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (4:23) : marketing. Yeah. So it's gonna be, Yoav, Rafael, and Rotem. And then on our on our side, on the marketing side, it's me, Nina, Asaf. Laura is sometimes in there as well. Okay. Yeah. It's basically just to dive a little bit deeper into some of the features to figure out whether like, which   
ofer: (4:43) : ones are   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (4:43) : worth big pieces and, like, a small announcement.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (4:47) : Okay. And then typically typically, if I still have questions, I   
ofer: (4:52) : have   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (4:52) : to basically contact the product, the PM directly.   
ofer: (4:57) : To ask,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (4:57) : like, the direct questions that I have. Because sometimes it's only when I'm working on   
ofer: (5:01) : the   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (5:02) : strategy and the details that I'm like, oh, wait. I forgot to ask about   
ofer: (5:05) : this   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (5:05) : because you know, I wasn't in the zone yet, and now I'm in the zone.   
ofer: (5:08) : So   
ofer: (5:11) : But how, like,   
ofer: (5:14) : there I understood there's a Slack channel   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (5:17) : of   
ofer: (5:17) : the feature just up upcoming. Do you read   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (5:20) : it?   
ofer: (5:21) : I   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (5:21) : do. I basically have to digest whatever is in there. There's a lot of conversations that are in Hebrew,   
ofer: (5:27) : which make it a   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (5:28) : little bit of a disadvantage for me. Okay. But some of the stuff that is in English, like, some of the docs that they have, I basically will take them it into ChachiPTi and also, like, try   
ofer: (5:39) : to   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (5:39) : move if there's something I don't understand, like, I put into ChachiPTi to kinda, like, make them help me, like, understand it. I can get it in a nontechnical language, and that will help me with some of the communications that we have for our users who are   
ofer: (5:52) : nontechnical.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (5:53) : So   
ofer: (5:54) : But I am Yeah.   
ofer: (5:58) : So yeah, Then   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:00) : gone.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:02) : Yeah.   
ofer: (6:03) : So   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:03) : a lot of my job is piecing together details from the   
ofer: (6:08) : actual   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:08) : meeting from the Slack   
ofer: (6:11) : channels   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:11) : and also like, public knowledge as to, like, what is available out there for more competition. To see if they have this. Typically, sometimes the product managers have this knowledge, and they're like, oh, Lovable has this and Replica doesn't or Replip has it and Lovable doesn't. So that's helpful for   
ofer: (6:27) : some of   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:28) : our for   
ofer: (6:29) : context.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:29) : Mhmm. But yeah, it's basically just me fact finding and then, like, coming together   
ofer: (6:35) : with a plan. So so you do a market research also with the which is each announcement just to get the, the sense of   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:43) : what's   
ofer: (6:43) : out there?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:44) : Also. Yeah. Yeah. And the reason for that is some of the stuff that we   
ofer: (6:49) : are   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:49) : launching has already been out there with our comp with our competitors. So we Yeah. Have to decide whether to make a big   
ofer: (6:56) : deal   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:57) : out of it. Like, is it worth making   
ofer: (6:58) : a big   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (6:59) : deal if the competition has had it for a while already? So that helps temper, like,   
ofer: (7:03) : some   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:04) : of the the the strategy and   
ofer: (7:05) : the   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:05) : planning.   
ofer: (7:07) : I gotcha. So, let me get it if I got got it straight. You kind of copy paste the Slack channel into Cheggipity.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:17) : Some   
ofer: (7:17) : of   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:17) : the   
ofer: (7:18) : details. Yeah. Yeah. Make it,   
ofer: (7:22) : nontechnical,   
ofer: (7:24) : language understood, what's the feature is all about. See what other have also, see if it's like a   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:30) : it's a   
ofer: (7:31) : big feature, small feature. What   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:33) : angle   
ofer: (7:33) : to to talk about   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:35) : it. Mhmm.   
ofer: (7:36) : And then start to write   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:39) : content   
ofer: (7:40) : Yeah. About   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:40) : it? Or Yes.   
ofer: (7:42) : Yes. Which the the content creation has a procedure. Like, you have I don't know.   
ofer: (7:50) : Tools you use, to of voice you usually use,   
ofer: (7:54) : to just iterative process with with chat CPT?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (7:58) : Is it I think it's an it's an iterative process. Sometimes they'll throw in like, examples of past launches we've done so that there's   
ofer: (8:07) : some sort of,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:07) : like, tone of voice. But you'll find out that we also don't have   
ofer: (8:11) : a   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:12) : set brand guidelines, which   
ofer: (8:14) : is   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:14) : kind of   
ofer: (8:16) : crazy.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:17) : Somebody from my team attempted to ask Shay if he could work on that, and   
ofer: (8:21) : Shay   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:22) : said no for some weird   
ofer: (8:23) : reason. So   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:24) : Mhmm. I think he thought it would evolve and come out on its own, but it's not.   
ofer: (8:27) : Like,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:29) : I think all of us have a different style and voice when it comes to   
ofer: (8:32) : writing.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:33) : But I have been writing all of the emails, so I guess my voice is the one that's coming   
ofer: (8:37) : out   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:37) : a little bit more. And I think Chachi Puthi has kind of figured out my voice based on, like, the months that we've been   
ofer: (8:43) : working together. Yeah. Can you, ask him, Chachi p your Chachi p t? What's the tone   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (8:53) : of   
ofer: (8:53) : voice and Okay. Copy paste it for me somewhere. Okay. Just to I I will try to gather a   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:00) : document.   
ofer: (9:01) : Finally, for for it.   
ofer: (9:04) : And also emails that you've been sent. If you have, like, a copy of emails, like,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:09) : a text I have it in a Google Doc. All of the transactional emails and all of the promotional emails we   
ofer: (9:13) : sent. So   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:13) : I can   
ofer: (9:14) : send that to you as   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:14) : well. Amazing.   
ofer: (9:16) : Amazing. You can send it to me? And I was I was talking to, forgot her name. Just write writing the technical document.   
ofer: (9:26) : Tova?   
ofer: (9:27) : No. For our, website, docs   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:31) : at   
ofer: (9:31) : Oh,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:31) : Amanda?   
ofer: (9:33) : Yeah. The knowledge   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:34) : base. Amazing.   
ofer: (9:35) : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and she said you have, a like, a similar process and you that that you are, talking to each other It's no, to to gather information together.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:46) : Yeah. So, I I take some of her docs If she has   
ofer: (9:51) : already   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:51) : written a doc, if there is, like, a particular language that   
ofer: (9:53) : she   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:54) : uses, I   
ofer: (9:54) : pretty   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (9:54) : much put that in as well. Mhmm. Just so we have, like, cohesive language across, like, all of our   
ofer: (10:01) : our assets. Mhmm.   
ofer: (10:04) : And is there a specific place you communicate, like share docs or   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:09) : or   
ofer: (10:10) : does like, just just a Slack   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:12) : DM No. In Slack? Well, we'll DM on Slack and be like, do you have this? Do you have this? And it's just   
ofer: (10:19) : Cool. You don't have a a channel, like, for notes?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:23) : Okay.   
ofer: (10:26) : And once you know, upcoming feature, let let's say, like, the custom MCP or MCPs coming next weeks now, something   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:34) : like that?   
ofer: (10:35) : Yeah. What what what's the process now?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:37) : Like, So   
ofer: (10:39) : Like, walk me through a process   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:40) : like this. Sure. Since I haven't started yet.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:44) : So one of the that's the Figma file.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:49) : From the   
ofer: (10:50) : UX   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:50) : team so that I can walk myself through the process. I don't know if the   
ofer: (10:54) : Velino   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:55) : is up yet. I didn't see it, which is why the Figma is   
ofer: (10:57) : helpful   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:58) : for me. And   
ofer: (10:59) : I basically,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (10:59) : like, walked through the process with the UX person so I could understand how the process is. And then I kind of,   
ofer: (11:04) : like, type   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:06) : it out to chat GPT so that   
ofer: (11:07) : they   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:07) : understand the process that I've seen. Yep. And then I also ask it to, like, talk to me about MCPs and Mhmm. See how we can digest this in a very nontechnical way for audiences. From there, I basically will also look through the channels to find, like, other pieces of information that I think are worth mentioning. And then I will,   
ofer: (11:29) : basically   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:30) : have it come   
ofer: (11:31) : up   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:31) : with, a   
ofer: (11:32) : LinkedIn   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:33) : caption for me, an x caption,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:37) : an email newsletter blurb,   
ofer: (11:39) : the   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:39) : in app notification, which is on the   
ofer: (11:41) : what's   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:41) : new. And then from there, I ask it, like, could you you have   
ofer: (11:45) : any   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:45) : ideas? Prior to you   
ofer: (11:47) : coming in,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:48) : Laura and I   
ofer: (11:49) : would   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:50) : basically   
ofer: (11:50) : create   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:51) : an app and then create a video demo,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:55) : basically showing the   
ofer: (11:56) : feature   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:56) : in that app in the   
ofer: (11:57) : demo environment.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (11:59) : Mhmm. So I think you are gonna save us a lot of effort when it comes to that.   
ofer: (12:05) : So you you're you're testing the the the the feature in the in the testing environment also before you   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:13) : Yeah. Just to make sure that it actually works, and then create an create a video because that's part of the marketing   
ofer: (12:20) : assets   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:20) : that we   
ofer: (12:21) : we   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:21) : would   
ofer: (12:22) : launch with. Like a like a walk through video? Like   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:24) : yeah.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:26) : We do a lot of demo videos. Yeah.   
ofer: (12:29) : On a screen screen recorder   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:31) : or   
ofer: (12:31) : screen   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:31) : share or   
ofer: (12:32) : something. Yeah.   
ofer: (12:35) : And then you you make a presentation. I saw it, like, you making   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:39) : a   
ofer: (12:39) : slideshow know,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:40) : something like that. Yeah. I make a full deck of   
ofer: (12:43) : slides with   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:45) : the because not all of the marketers know the same thing that I   
ofer: (12:49) : know, so   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:49) : I try to put all of our knowledge together. And then I   
ofer: (12:52) : basically   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:52) : walk   
ofer: (12:52) : through the   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:53) : plan.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:54) : This also helps because when I   
ofer: (12:56) : share   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:56) : it with the   
ofer: (12:57) : product   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (12:57) : team, they can tell me if the knowledge that I have   
ofer: (13:00) : is   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (13:00) : wrong. And, they can also, like, critique and give feedback on some of the marketing assets. That I've   
ofer: (13:06) : created. Okay. And and you do it on a daily basis, month like, weekly basis? Like, talking to or just hey, product team, see the slide show. I mean, like,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (13:18) : I I basically throw it into into this when I'm done, and then now they're asking me to put it in the Slack channel, which I haven't been doing, but I should.   
ofer: (13:27) : Where? On the on the feeds?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (13:29) : The features? They they want me to start putting it in in each individual feature   
ofer: (13:33) : channel,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (13:34) : though. Mhmm.   
ofer: (13:36) : And how how,   
ofer: (13:39) : how much before the, little lunch? Does it take? Like, it's a week,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (13:44) : a   
ofer: (13:44) : day, an hour?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (13:46) : Or yeah. I I'm gonna be honest with you. It depends. If it's if I'm lucky and it's a feature that has   
ofer: (13:54) : issues,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (13:55) : it ends up being a week before. But sometimes, I   
ofer: (13:59) : don't have   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (13:59) : that time because the demo environment is not ready or it has bugs, and   
ofer: (14:05) : then they end up   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:06) : taking up from features   
ofer: (14:08) : from   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:08) : it. So for example, plan mode. I planned that almost a week in advance. Like, I   
ofer: (14:13) : created,   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:14) : like, the assets to copy they didn't like the app that I made or the video,   
ofer: (14:18) : so Laura   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:19) : has   
ofer: (14:19) : to   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:19) : do it. But now the launch has been moved because   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:24) : the app the the feature itself is buggy.   
ofer: (14:27) : So   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:27) : we have all of the marketing assets now, but we just don't have the app because the app buggy. The feature is buggy. So so at   
ofer: (14:34) : least I'm   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:34) : done with that, but I have to work on other launches. So everything for next week, I'm basically gonna work on on Friday.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:41) : And then hopefully, get it to Shai on Sunday to review.   
ofer: (14:45) : So so you prepare Shai review it, and then you kinda fix it when you launch?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:52) : Yes. The issue is   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (14:55) : Shay is not the   
ofer: (14:57) : most   
ofer: (14:58) : responsive with   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (15:00) : reviewing   
ofer: (15:01) : all of   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (15:02) : the assets. So a lot of our stuff ends up last minute. When he   
ofer: (15:05) : finally   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (15:06) : looks at it, decides he doesn't like and then we have to   
ofer: (15:08) : basically   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (15:09) : run around   
ofer: (15:10) : and fix it. Read it. Uh-huh.   
ofer: (15:17) : That's that's I cannot fix in automations. That's   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (15:24) : Maybe.   
ofer: (15:25) : Yeah.   
ofer: (15:30) : Like, probably a set of thing that did got published. No? Like, things that he did like and you you did publish Can can   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (15:40) : you can you   
ofer: (15:40) : share   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (15:40) : it with   
ofer: (15:40) : me? Yeah. We   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (15:43) : sure. I can and he comply   
ofer: (15:45) : with.   
ofer: (15:47) : Think If it's in a   
ofer: (15:50) : I can analyze it a bit and maybe yeah,   
ofer: (15:56) : give the AI more directions and see you can create some more more ideas.   
ofer: (16:02) : Yeah. What what's what is, something that you're imagining can happen? Like, something   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:08) : that   
ofer: (16:08) : you think could be   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:11) : a game changer?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:19) : I I don't   
ofer: (16:20) : know. I've   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:22) : been I feel like I've   
ofer: (16:23) : been   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:23) : operating on panic mode   
ofer: (16:25) : for the last Yeah.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:26) : Yeah. Yeah. So   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:30) : like, I think   
ofer: (16:30) : things   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:31) : are I I think in terms of this app, I think if there's just an easy way to be able to   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:38) : figure out the voice because again, we we don't have a set tone of voice. I think Laura on social has voice. I handle the emails. And some of the feature releases, and I have my own   
ofer: (16:50) : voice.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:50) : And then the community and the Discord   
ofer: (16:53) : channel   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:54) : has its   
ofer: (16:54) : own voice   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:54) : with its own audience. And then   
ofer: (16:56) : Nina who runs the live   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (16:56) : Hey,   
ofer: (16:58) : Sam.   
ofer: (17:00) : Sam.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (17:01) : And then Nina handles all of the landing pages. So she has her own voice. I think finding a way to come together into one cohesive brand voice is going   
ofer: (17:09) : to   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (17:10) : help. And that way, like, it could be a single source of truth, and it will make it much   
ofer: (17:14) : easier   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (17:15) : to create assets because   
ofer: (17:17) : right   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (17:18) : now, when I create assets, I have to run through approvals between Shai   
ofer: (17:21) : and   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (17:22) : Ron. Ron is the   
ofer: (17:23) : release manager.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (17:26) : And Ron knows the product a little bit more, so I think I'm a little bit more geared towards his language. But Shay is the marketer, He's the head of marketing. So at the end of the day, like, what he says goes.   
ofer: (17:40) : Is it, have we   
ofer: (17:44) : done any meeting? Like, align a line of voice. Like, with have you have you done it? Like, Sam, you, Laura,

ofer: (18:01) : good idea?   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (18:01) : Or I I do think it's a good idea, and I think that it's worth you asking for that.   
ofer: (18:07) : I think   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (18:07) : that we found out that he didn't want James to work on it, and   
ofer: (18:12) : we kind   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (18:12) : of got   
ofer: (18:13) : discouraged.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (18:14) : I think Asaf might have asked Shay, and I think I think Shay said no, but you should ask Asaf   
ofer: (18:20) : if   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (18:20) : that's if I'm   
ofer: (18:21) : remembering that   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (18:22) : correctly.   
ofer: (18:22) : Yep.   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (18:23) : I I do think it would be a good idea for all of us to align   
ofer: (18:26) : because   
Tiffany Lauren Qua: (18:28) : we know more about our customers now. I think that we should be a little bit more cohesive about that.
