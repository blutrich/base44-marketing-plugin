**Speaker 1 (22.83)**: So  this  is  the  system. 

**Speaker 1 (24.29)**:  This  is  the  backend? 

**Speaker 1 (25.63)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (25.77)**:  this  is  the  backend. 

**Speaker 1 (27.5)**:  It  connects  to  GitHub. 

**Speaker 1 (28.34)**:  It's  kind  of  complex. 

**Speaker 2 (29.8)**:  What's  that? 

**Speaker 1 (30.44)**:  It  connects  to  GitHub. 

**Speaker 1 (33.2)**:  But  yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (33.56)**:  and  then  everything  is  published  in  here. 

**Speaker 1 (37.73)**:  have  like  we  have  two  sections  we  have  the  regular  documentation  this  is  for  regular  users  now  we  have  the  dev  docs  which  is  tech  team  right  the  tech  writers  okay  and  under  the  documentation  the  audience  is 

**Speaker 1 (52.95)**:  tech  people  like  you  write  for  so  this  is  for  regular  regular  users  and  we  actually  just  moved  more  techy  stuff  even  like  github  editing  the  code  we  put  all  in  the  developers  docs  now  um  this  is  really  for  like  basic 

**Speaker 2 (68.18)**:  users  okay  yeah  and  you  get  the  information  from  github  or  from 

**Speaker 2 (73.7)**:  how  do  you  how  do  you  i  get  it  from  the  product  team  for  product  team  yeah  and  the  devs  yeah 

**Speaker 2 (82.97)**:  so  what  I'm  trying  to  solve  for  the  marketing  team  so  it's  hard  to  get  the  information  was  that  yeah  so  it  comes  in  different  ways  just  to  streamline  their  operation  of  a  feature  release  so  so  okay  so  my  main  it 

**Speaker 1 (99.71)**:  mainly  comes  from  the  product  team  so  you  have  what  Rotem  or  Raphael  okay 

**Speaker 1 (107.52)**:  It  also, 

**Speaker 1 (108.44)**:  I  guess, 

**Speaker 1 (108.78)**:  comes  from  marketing, 

**Speaker 1 (109.86)**:  because  they  sometimes  hear  about  it  before  me. 

**Speaker 1 (112.76)**:  But  also, 

**Speaker 1 (114.19)**:  the  devs, 

**Speaker 1 (114.69)**:  it  depends  on  what  it  is. 

**Speaker 1 (115.95)**:  Like, 

**Speaker 1 (116.15)**:  if  it's  just  something  a  dev  has  done. 

**Speaker 2 (117.91)**:  So  the  MCP  integration. 

**Speaker 1 (119.63)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (119.75)**:  What's  he  going  to  do? 

**Speaker 1 (120.33)**:  What's  he  going 

**Speaker 1 (121.97)**:  to... 

**Speaker 1 (123.13)**:  how  are  you  gonna 

**Speaker 1 (124.99)**:  the  way  it  works  is  I  just  got  added  to  the  slack  channel  okay 

**Speaker 2 (127.76)**:  I  need  to  understand  everything  from  the  slack  channel  the  feature  like  the  yeah  the  feature  slack  channel  yeah  yeah  the  new  one  day  yeah  so  I  mean  like  every  single  such  time  in  the  world 

**Speaker 1 (139.11)**:  okay  so  reading  through  the  comments  and  yeah  yeah  and  then  i'll  speak  to  the  pm  and  the  dev  usually  you  get  more  information  yeah  wrote  them  and  you  have  whoever  is  working  on  it  like  the  mcp  one  for  example  there's  uh  it's  rafael  but  it's  also  i  get  more  information  from  the  dev 

**Speaker 1 (154.62)**:  guy 

**Speaker 1 (154.88)**:  who's  working  on  it  so  i  met  with  him  yesterday  and  how  do  you  know  who  is  the  dev  that's  working  on  it  i  just  see  in  the  slack  channel  yeah  okay  the  slack  channels  are  good  actually  because  I  can  just  ask  like  it's  much  easier  having  these. 

**Speaker 2 (166.57)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 2 (167.33)**:  And  then  when  do  you  publish? 

**Speaker 2 (171.29)**:  Like  when, 

**Speaker 2 (171.58)**:  like  what's  your  flow? 

**Speaker 2 (172.16)**:  You  have  all  the  information, 

**Speaker 2 (173.14)**:  you  put  it  in  a  doc? 

**Speaker 2 (175.74)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (175.9)**:  yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (176.08)**:  I  have  it  ready. 

**Speaker 1 (176.66)**:  I  have  it  in  like  draft  and  then  I  publish  whenever, 

**Speaker 1 (179.38)**:  as  soon  as  it's  released, 

**Speaker 1 (180.2)**:  I'll  publish. 

**Speaker 2 (181.4)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 1 (181.86)**:  But  often  it's  like, 

**Speaker 1 (182.99)**:  it  might  be  a  little  bit  different  to  what  I  expect  when  it's  released  or  like  whatever. 

**Speaker 1 (187.67)**:  At  least  within  a  day, 

**Speaker 1 (188.65)**:  it'll  get  published. 

**Speaker 2 (189.85)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 2 (190.37)**:  And  where  do  you  gather  all  the  information? 

**Speaker 2 (192.83)**:  You  put  it  in  somewhere  in  the  doc? 

**Speaker 2 (196.4)**:  Is  it? 

**Speaker 1 (197.1)**:  I  mean, 

**Speaker 2 (199.08)**:  is  it  accessible  to  the  team  before? 

**Speaker 1 (202.24)**:  I  usually  just  need  the  testing  environment  and  maybe  just  read  some  background  information  about  it. 

**Speaker 1 (209.52)**:  So  I  don't  have  a  place  where  I  keep  stuff. 

**Speaker 1 (212.29)**:  I  don't  really  need  a  place  to  keep  stuff. 

**Speaker 1 (214.23)**:  Because  I  usually  just  play  with  it. 

**Speaker 1 (216.29)**:  I  play  with  the  product. 

**Speaker 2 (217.49)**:  And  when  do  you  write  about  it? 

**Speaker 1 (221.41)**:  As  soon  as  there's  something  I  can  play  with. 

**Speaker 2 (224.95)**:  So  you  play  with  it  and  you  have  like  a... 

**Speaker 2 (226.82)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (226.98)**:  and  then  I  ask  questions  at  the  end  or  whatever. 

**Speaker 2 (229.2)**:  And  you  start  writing? 

**Speaker 1 (230.26)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (231.1)**:  A  draft? 

**Speaker 1 (231.98)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (232.26)**:  And  just  before, 

**Speaker 2 (233.21)**:  like  a  Google  Doc  draft? 

**Speaker 1 (235.17)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (235.31)**:  I  do  it  in  Mintify. 

**Speaker 2 (236.67)**:  Oh, 

**Speaker 2 (237.11)**:  inside  the  backend? 

**Speaker 1 (238.79)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (239.61)**:  And  then  I  usually, 

**Speaker 1 (242.19)**:  I'll  send  it, 

**Speaker 1 (243.0)**:  like  I'm  just  working  on  the  MCP  one  now, 

**Speaker 1 (244.84)**:  so  this  is  the  draft, 

**Speaker 1 (245.86)**:  so  I  can  actually  send  the  preview. 

**Speaker 2 (249.24)**:  Is  it  something  that  you  build  or  it's  a  thing? 

**Speaker 2 (252.1)**:  No, 

**Speaker 2 (252.76)**:  no, 

**Speaker 1 (253.1)**:  it's  a  content  management  system. 

**Speaker 1 (255.39)**:  Ah, 

**Speaker 2 (255.62)**:  okay, 

**Speaker 2 (255.85)**:  okay. 

**Speaker 1 (257.05)**:  So  then 

**Speaker 1 (257.67)**:  I'll  get 

**Speaker 1 (259.25)**:  the  preview  and  I'll  send  it  to  the 

**Speaker 1 (261.89)**:  product  manager  or  the  dev  and  I'll  say  here  it  is, 

**Speaker 1 (264.61)**:  let  me  know  if  you  have  any  comments. 

**Speaker 2 (266.45)**:  Is  it  something  that  I  can  use  to  automate  for  them? 

**Speaker 2 (269.22)**:  marketing  team  uh  no  this  is  specifically  for  writing  documentation  yeah  for  sure  i  need  to  like  repurpose  it  but  if  somebody  gather  all  the  information  about  the  future  somewhere 

**Speaker 2 (283.52)**:  like  often  like  tiffany  or  whatever  will  ask  for  the  doc  okay  to  write  her  stuff  but  it's  not  always  ready 

**Speaker 2 (291.57)**:  So  you  send  a 

**Speaker 2 (293.19)**:  Google  Doc? 

**Speaker 1 (293.55)**:  So  we  kind  of  like  share. 

**Speaker 1 (295.29)**:  She  tells  me  what  she  knows  and  I  tell  her  what  I  know. 

**Speaker 2 (297.97)**:  And  you  combine? 

**Speaker 1 (298.83)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (299.71)**:  Where? 

**Speaker 2 (300.37)**:  Where  does  it  happen? 

**Speaker 2 (301.72)**:  No, 

**Speaker 2 (301.92)**:  it's  just  on  Slack. 

**Speaker 2 (302.94)**:  On  Slack? 

**Speaker 1 (303.56)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (303.92)**:  So  you  open  a  new  channel  or  just  a  DM? 

**Speaker 1 (306.14)**:  It's  usually  just  me  and  Tiffany  actually. 

**Speaker 2 (307.72)**:  Just  a  DM? 

**Speaker 1 (308.36)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (308.8)**:  yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (309.94)**:  Because  she  often  like  will  meet  with  the  PMs. 

**Speaker 1 (313.03)**:  I  guess  it's  different  because  I'm  also  here. 

**Speaker 1 (315.31)**:  Well, 

**Speaker 1 (316.23)**:  Rotem's  there  I  guess. 

**Speaker 1 (317.29)**:  But  she'll  often  meet  with  them. 

**Speaker 1 (319.67)**:  I  don't  always  meet  with  them, 

**Speaker 1 (321.12)**:  it  depends, 

**Speaker 1 (321.58)**:  I  don't  necessarily  need  to, 

**Speaker 1 (323.02)**:  but  she  needs  to  understand  the  marketing  message  more  from  them  I  think. 

**Speaker 2 (326.74)**:  So  she  do  meeting  with  the  PMs  and  you  share  information? 

**Speaker 1 (330.24)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (330.54)**:  we  share  information. 

**Speaker 2 (331.54)**:  On  DM? 

**Speaker 1 (332.7)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (334.56)**:  Very  efficient. 

**Speaker 2 (339.29)**:  My  idea  is  to, 

**Speaker 2 (341.39)**:  like, 

**Speaker 2 (341.95)**:  I  want  to  build  an  automation  that's  streamlined  the  process  and  digest  the  information. 

**Speaker 2 (348.67)**:  to  marketing  messages  already. 

**Speaker 2 (351.09)**:  Like  the  output, 

**Speaker 2 (351.93)**:  let's  say, 

**Speaker 2 (353.71)**:  social  media, 

**Speaker 2 (354.65)**:  let's  say, 

**Speaker 2 (355.11)**:  like  a  draft  for 

**Speaker 2 (356.95)**:  Tiffany,  draft  for 

**Speaker 2 (358.83)**:  Laura,  draft  for 

**Speaker 1 (361.13)**:  X.  And  it  also  needs  to  include  like  the  intent  of  the, 

**Speaker 1 (364.99)**:  like, 

**Speaker 1 (365.18)**:  you  know. 

**Speaker 2 (366.14)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 2 (366.78)**:  but  that's  something  that  can  be... 

**Speaker 1 (370.78)**:  Like  what  the  product  team  can  help  with, 

**Speaker 1 (372.04)**:  I  guess. 

**Speaker 2 (373.18)**:  It  can  be  fixed, 

**Speaker 2 (373.96)**:  like  there's 

**Speaker 2 (376.74)**:  four  personas. 

**Speaker 2 (378.59)**:  One  is  the  technical  one, 

**Speaker 2 (379.8)**:  one  is  the 

**Speaker 2 (381.2)**:  regular  guy, 

**Speaker 2 (382.44)**:  one  is  the  dev  team, 

**Speaker 2 (384.6)**:  I  don't  know. 

**Speaker 2 (385.44)**:  And  it's  repeating, 

**Speaker 2 (386.96)**:  no? 

**Speaker 2 (388.2)**:  We  have  the  voice  of  the... 

**Speaker 1 (389.48)**:  I  think  another  thing  that's  missing, 

**Speaker 1 (391.06)**:  like  with  the  docs  specifically, 

**Speaker 1 (394.54)**:  I  work  very  closely  with  support. 

**Speaker 1 (396.7)**:  So  it's  kind  of  like, 

**Speaker 1 (400.24)**:  as  soon  as  something  is  released, 

**Speaker 1 (401.92)**:  I  often  get  feedback, 

**Speaker 1 (403.06)**:  we're  getting  tickets  about  this, 

**Speaker 1 (403.97)**:  we  need  to  add  this  information  in, 

**Speaker 1 (405.19)**:  we're  missing  this, 

**Speaker 1 (405.95)**:  da 

**Speaker 1 (407.07)**:  How  do  you  communicate  with 

**Speaker 1 (409.51)**:  them? 

**Speaker 1 (411.55)**:  On  the  support  channel  or  meetings  that  come  in  with  the  management. 

**Speaker 1 (418.23)**:  It's  very  support  focused  because  the  docs  are  used  in  support  when  someone  contacts  us. 

**Speaker 1 (423.0)**:  And  they  get  the  AI  chatbot. 

**Speaker 1 (424.66)**:  It  uses  the  docs. 

**Speaker 1 (426.46)**:  We  try  to  block  a  lot  of  tickets  with  it. 

**Speaker 1 (428.62)**:  So  a  lot  of  the  questions  that  come  in, 

**Speaker 1 (430.16)**:  I  have  to  have  the  information  here. 

**Speaker 1 (432.7)**:  list  of  uh  questions  like  faqs  yeah  yeah  they  can  send  me  a  request  when  things  are  missing  that  they  need  adding  to  the  docs  or  things  are  changing  like  they  just  send  me  a  request  they  have  like  a  request  system 

**Speaker 1 (446.12)**:  um  yeah  and  they  can  just  literally 

**Speaker 1 (447.74)**:  submit  a  request  to  me. 

**Speaker 2 (448.78)**:  This  is  on  page  44? 

**Speaker 2 (450.24)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 2 (450.42)**:  yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (450.62)**:  this  is  my  app. 

**Speaker 1 (451.64)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 2 (452.02)**:  this  is  my  app, 

**Speaker 1 (453.32)**:  my  calendar. 

**Speaker 2 (454.02)**:  You  build  it? 

**Speaker 1 (454.8)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (456.23)**:  Nice. 

**Speaker 1 (457.23)**:  So  like  I've  got  all  of  my  tasks  here  but  I  need  to  work  on  too  many  of  them. 

**Speaker 1 (461.81)**:  But  they're  too  bad  to  do. 

**Speaker 1 (464.99)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (465.23)**:  so 

**Speaker 1 (466.07)**:  I  get  in  requests  and  then 

**Speaker 1 (469.28)**:  I  can  work  on  them  as  well. 

**Speaker 1 (470.62)**:  That's  aside  from  the  new  features. 

**Speaker 1 (472.12)**:  This  is  like... 

**Speaker 2 (473.2)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 2 (473.56)**:  support. 

**Speaker 1 (474.22)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (474.78)**:  exactly. 

**Speaker 2 (475.26)**:  like  updated  docs. 

**Speaker 1 (477.76)**:  something  you're  missing  yeah  yeah 

**Speaker 1 (481.24)**:  okay 

**Speaker 1 (484.01)**:  um  okay  just  so  also  like  for  example  here  like  uh  from  the  ux  yeah  for  example  tell  me  about  this  feature  so  it's  not  always  from  the  pms  it  might  be  something  hen's  working  on  like 

**Speaker 2 (493.55)**:  they  actually  added  a  setting  to  something  in  the  ux  um  it  seems  that  you're  a  good  source  of  truth  i'm  in  the  middle  of  everything  yeah  i  get  it 

**Speaker 1 (503.22)**:  Then  if  it's  the  source  of  truth, 

**Speaker 1 (504.22)**:  that  was  the  source  of  spam. 

**Speaker 1 (506.66)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (506.84)**:  I  get  from  everywhere, 

**Speaker 1 (507.62)**:  from  the  devs, 

**Speaker 1 (508.12)**:  from  marketing, 

**Speaker 1 (508.8)**:  from  product, 

**Speaker 1 (509.86)**:  from  the  UX, 

**Speaker 1 (511.14)**:  from  support. 

**Speaker 2 (514.68)**:  And  timeline-wise, 

**Speaker 2 (517.14)**:  do  they  share  on  social  before  you  update  the  docs? 

**Speaker 2 (520.33)**:  Or  do  you  update  before  they  share  on  social? 

**Speaker 1 (523.27)**:  It's  usually  the  same  time. 

**Speaker 1 (526.91)**:  Like, 

**Speaker 1 (527.53)**:  usually  as  soon  as  it's  released, 

**Speaker 1 (528.79)**:  I'll  have  it  ready. 

**Speaker 1 (529.67)**:  Hopefully. 

**Speaker 1 (530.8)**:  In  an  ideal  way. 

**Speaker 1 (531.84)**:  Usually. 

**Speaker 2 (532.32)**:  And  then  you're  gonna  share  it? 

**Speaker 1 (533.68)**:  And  then  they'll... 

**Speaker 1 (534.54)**:  put  it  on  social, 

**Speaker 1 (535.58)**:  sometimes  they  share  the  link  to  the  doc  or  sometimes  like  in  the  email  for  example  if  there's  an  email  they  often  need  the  link  to  the  doc. 

**Speaker 2 (543.86)**:  Who  sends  the  emails? 

**Speaker 1 (545.16)**:  Tiffany. 

**Speaker 2 (548.08)**:  So  you  probably  need  to  work  on  the  marketing  messages  before  the  day? 

**Speaker 1 (552.87)**:  Yes. 

**Speaker 1 (554.87)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (555.05)**:  yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (555.17)**:  the  marketing, 

**Speaker 1 (555.99)**:  yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (556.83)**:  Probably. 

**Speaker 1 (557.81)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (558.01)**:  it  needs  to  be  done  before. 

**Speaker 2 (559.61)**:  And  when  do  you, 

**Speaker 2 (562.05)**:  like, 

**Speaker 2 (562.57)**:  what... 

**Speaker 2 (563.89)**:  Do  you  finish  usually  ahead  of  time  or  like  it's  on  the  day  of  the  physical  release? 

**Speaker 1 (568.79)**:  Usually  it's  not  ready. 

**Speaker 1 (569.94)**:  Like  the  thing  they're  releasing  today, 

**Speaker 1 (571.04)**:  the  workspaces  and  whatever, 

**Speaker 1 (572.44)**:  it's  not  even  ready  yet. 

**Speaker 1 (573.06)**:  I  can't  even  see  it. 

**Speaker 1 (574.1)**:  So 

**Speaker 1 (575.92)**:  it's  very, 

**Speaker 1 (576.7)**:  very  last  minute  usually  here  in  baseball. 

**Speaker 1 (580.14)**:  It's  very  last  minute. 

**Speaker 1 (582.82)**:  Not  always, 

**Speaker 1 (583.96)**:  but  things  definitely  change  to  the  last  minute. 

**Speaker 2 (586.7)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (587.72)**:  And  they  can  change  up  to  the  last  second. 

**Speaker 2 (589.8)**:  And 

**Speaker 2 (591.42)**:  what  do  you  do? 

**Speaker 1 (592.28)**:  How  do  you  get? 

**Speaker 1 (592.54)**:  I  just  work  24  hours  a  day. 

**Speaker 1 (597.04)**:  a  day  literally  how  do  you  know  about  it  and  they  usually  tell  me  oh  they're  right  on  the  slack  mate  on  the  channel  yeah  yeah  yeah  everything's  going  in  there  now  which  is  good  this  is  a  good  good  place  the  slack  channels  are  really  good  it's  just  uh  for  example  this  is  all 

**Speaker 1 (609.48)**:  all  start  with  well  this  is  the  problem  i  am  specifically  in  every  single  one  which  is  very  overwhelming  um  but  again  i  need  to  be  because  if  i  know  like  there's  a  message  in  here  and  it's  is  coming  out  now, 

**Speaker 1 (619.98)**:  like  today, 

**Speaker 1 (620.58)**:  I  need  to 

**Speaker 1 (621.96)**:  see  what  they're  talking  about. 

**Speaker 2 (623.67)**:  um  but  this  is  the  venice  one  so  yeah  so  i'm  in  a  lot  can  you  can  you  describe  your  how  do  you  do  it  a  little  bit  you  like  you  open  this  live  channel  usually  in  the  morning  it's  like  full  of  comments  so  i  have  to  go  through 

**Speaker 1 (638.86)**:  and  organize  my  thoughts  and  my  priorities  because  for  example  like  plan  mood  we  thought  that  was  coming  out  today  and  it's  not  coming  out  to  next  week  so  now  i  can  ignore  that  one  for  a  couple  days  um  so  how  do  you  know  it's  not  coming  because  we  have  this  one  that  they  sent  this  morning 

**Speaker 2 (654.5)**:  This  one. 

**Speaker 1 (656.44)**:  So  it  says  that  this  one  has  been  moved  from  29... 

**Speaker 1 (659.98)**:  this  is  the  new  thing. 

**Speaker 2 (661.18)**:  So  I  need  to  get  on  it  too. 

**Speaker 2 (662.9)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (663.3)**:  there's... 

**Speaker 1 (664.52)**:  what's  the  difference  between  this  and  this? 

**Speaker 1 (666.54)**:  I  think  these  are  the  same, 

**Speaker 1 (667.36)**:  I  don't  know  why  there's  two  of  them. 

**Speaker 1 (669.0)**:  But  see  I've  got  it  here  as  well. 

**Speaker 1 (670.9)**:  Please  note  that  my  mode  has  been  changed. 

**Speaker 1 (673.73)**:  This  is  weird, 

**Speaker 1 (674.29)**:  it  came  to  here  yesterday  and  then  to  this  one  today. 

**Speaker 2 (678.75)**:  So  I'm  not  really 

**Speaker 2 (681.27)**:  sure. 

**Speaker 2 (683.59)**:  What's  the  name  of  this  site? 

**Speaker 2 (684.57)**:  Product  Sync? 

**Speaker 1 (685.51)**:  There's  two. 

**Speaker 1 (686.07)**:  There's  base  product  update  and  product  sync  updates. 

**Speaker 1 (689.79)**:  And  I  don't  know  why  there's  two. 

**Speaker 1 (696.42)**:  Do  a... 

**Speaker 1 (697.08)**:  yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (697.22)**:  product  sync  updates. 

**Speaker 1 (698.76)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (700.64)**:  Channel. 

**Speaker 1 (701.46)**:  But  they  seem  to  be... 

**Speaker 1 (702.7)**:  The  same? 

**Speaker 1 (703.2)**:  ...a  bit  different. 

**Speaker 1 (703.86)**:  I  don't  know. 

**Speaker 1 (707.75)**:  I  think  Yoav  is  using  one  and  Omer  set  up  another  one. 

**Speaker 1 (713.14)**:  and  base  product  updates 

**Speaker 1 (723.85)**:  also  so  for  example  like  today  you  have  just  wrote  this  morning  we're  deprecating  this  and 

**Speaker 1 (729.05)**:  i  saw  it  i'm  like  okay  i  need  to  add  this  to  the  docs  um  but  he  just  wrote  it  on  here 

**Speaker 1 (737.26)**:  so  then  like  i  asked  him  like  what  the  messaging  should  be 

**Speaker 1 (742.33)**:  told  me  okay  but  yeah  they  have  the  you  know  they  have  this  the  um  where  are  they  right  this  thing  hold  on  i  just  had  it  open  the  calendar  yeah  they  have  their  calendar  i  don't  know  where  it  is 

**Speaker 1 (759.14)**:  but 

**Speaker 1 (759.26)**:  you  know  what  i  mean  they're  marketing  uh  i  just  not  i'm  just 

**Speaker 2 (763.04)**:  I  just  know  about  it. 

**Speaker 2 (764.32)**:  So  this  is  your  apps. 

**Speaker 2 (765.12)**:  Like  five  minutes  ago. 

**Speaker 1 (766.38)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (766.62)**:  this  is  your  apps. 

**Speaker 1 (768.8)**:  I  have  my  own  because  mine's  slightly  different. 

**Speaker 1 (770.35)**:  This  one  has  marketing  on, 

**Speaker 1 (771.29)**:  so  I  need  to  have  my  own  separate  one. 

**Speaker 1 (773.61)**:  This  is  their  product  one  that  releases. 

**Speaker 1 (777.17)**:  But  it's  not  correct. 

**Speaker 1 (778.63)**:  No. 

**Speaker 1 (779.03)**:  I  mean, 

**Speaker 1 (779.35)**:  this  has  already  been  moved  and  it's  not  updated  on  here. 

**Speaker 2 (782.8)**:  This  is  the  plan. 

**Speaker 1 (784.08)**:  The  one  they  said  is  coming  out  next  week  now. 

**Speaker 1 (785.5)**:  It's  not  been  updated  on  here. 

**Speaker 2 (788.36)**:  It's  not  today. 

**Speaker 1 (789.64)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (789.76)**:  it's  not  today. 

**Speaker 2 (790.53)**:  And  you  already  released  the  docs? 

**Speaker 1 (793.03)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (793.15)**:  no, 

**Speaker 1 (793.27)**:  no, 

**Speaker 1 (793.47)**:  it's  ready  there. 

**Speaker 1 (794.69)**:  It's  ready. 

**Speaker 1 (796.19)**:  But  I  always, 

**Speaker 1 (797.77)**:  just  before  I  publish, 

**Speaker 1 (798.49)**:  you  obviously  have  to  go  and  check  that  it's  still  correct. 

**Speaker 1 (800.79)**:  Because, 

**Speaker 1 (801.21)**:  like, 

**Speaker 1 (802.21)**:  they  could  have  changed  stuff. 

**Speaker 2 (804.54)**:  And  once  you're  done  writing  the  docs... 

**Speaker 2 (808.02)**:  You  share  with  Tiffany  like  a  Google  Doc  or  something? 

**Speaker 2 (811.59)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (811.81)**:  I  have  a  Slack  channel 

**Speaker 1 (814.43)**:  that  it's  automatic  whenever  I  publish  something. 

**Speaker 1 (817.77)**:  It's  in  my  Docs  here. 

**Speaker 1 (819.99)**:  It's  this  one. 

**Speaker 1 (822.14)**:  So  for  example, 

**Speaker 1 (822.82)**:  I... 

**Speaker 1 (822.88)**:  Can  I  be  there? 

**Speaker 1 (823.92)**:  Oh, 

**Speaker 1 (824.04)**:  it's  yours. 

**Speaker 1 (824.72)**:  You  can  join  it. 

**Speaker 1 (825.64)**:  I  can... 

**Speaker 1 (826.12)**:  What's  the  name  of  it? 

**Speaker 1 (829.52)**:  Doc  Support  Hub. 

**Speaker 1 (830.54)**:  This  is  connected  to  my 

**Speaker 1 (833.49)**:  tasks. 

**Speaker 1 (834.51)**:  So  if  it's  something  important  that  I  feel  people  need  to  know  about, 

**Speaker 1 (837.43)**:  I'll... 

**Speaker 1 (838.12)**:  I'll  make  a  notification  on  here. 

**Speaker 1 (841.0)**:  It's  not  for  everything  but  it's  like  the  main  things. 

**Speaker 1 (843.92)**:  Often  it's  like  for  support  or  things  they've  asked  me  to  do 

**Speaker 1 (848.6)**:  or  a  new  feature. 

**Speaker 2 (850.7)**:  So  every  new  feature  you're  going  to  post  here  anyway? 

**Speaker 2 (853.06)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 2 (853.24)**:  I  post  it  when  it's  published. 

**Speaker 2 (853.78)**:  Or  is  it  automatically  somehow? 

**Speaker 2 (856.78)**:  Do  you  build  automations? 

**Speaker 2 (858.46)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (858.72)**:  it's  from  my  app. 

**Speaker 1 (859.56)**:  It's  like  when  I  publish  I  can  choose  to  send  a  notification. 

**Speaker 2 (861.62)**:  From  where? 

**Speaker 1 (862.22)**:  From  my  Docs. 

**Speaker 1 (863.38)**:  Ah, 

**Speaker 1 (863.56)**:  your  app. 

**Speaker 1 (863.98)**:  From  this  thing. 

**Speaker 1 (865.7)**:  Ah, 

**Speaker 2 (865.94)**:  nice. 

**Speaker 2 (866.18)**:  You  have  a  technical  background? 

**Speaker 1 (867.66)**:  something  well  i've  learned  it  through  writing  the  documentation  no  it's  it's  the  slack  connector  yeah  so  i  just  connected  it  and  um 

**Speaker 1 (876.57)**:  yeah  the  other  thing  is  um  we  now  have  um  so  the 

**Speaker 1 (882.01)**:  the  um  right 

**Speaker 1 (883.62)**:  the  ones  who  write  the  dev  docs 

**Speaker 1 (886.8)**:  there's  a  whole  team  of  them  now  um  and  it's  getting  a  little  bit  like  complicated  i  think  for  them  because  they're  still  in  wix  they're  not  they're  not  actually  in  base44 

**Speaker 1 (895.58)**:  So  for  example, 

**Speaker 1 (897.03)**:  they're  releasing  something  now, 

**Speaker 1 (899.21)**:  just  opening  the  files  of  the  apps. 

**Speaker 1 (901.27)**:  The  dev  told  me  they're  releasing  something, 

**Speaker 1 (902.93)**:  but  they  didn't  know  about  it. 

**Speaker 1 (904.39)**:  And  it's  their  thing. 

**Speaker 1 (906.11)**:  So  I  said  to  them, 

**Speaker 1 (907.03)**:  by  the  way, 

**Speaker 1 (907.45)**:  they're  releasing  this. 

**Speaker 1 (908.05)**:  They  said, 

**Speaker 1 (908.33)**:  oh, 

**Speaker 1 (908.39)**:  we  didn't  know. 

**Speaker 1 (909.55)**:  So  the  tech  writers  also  kind  of  need  to  be  involved  when  it's  something  that  they  need, 

**Speaker 1 (914.23)**:  that  is  in  their  domain. 

**Speaker 1 (918.43)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (919.64)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 2 (919.76)**:  And  there's 

**Speaker 2 (922.92)**:  product  manager  for... 

**Speaker 2 (924.31)**:  The  developers  side? 

**Speaker 1 (927.68)**:  I  think  they  just  work  straight  with  the  dev. 

**Speaker 1 (930.28)**:  I  think  they're  in  touch  straight  with  the  dev. 

**Speaker 2 (931.78)**:  There's  no  like  the  back  end  of  the  service? 

**Speaker 1 (936.54)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (936.7)**:  so  I  think  they're  working  directly  with  the  dev. 

**Speaker 1 (939.24)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (939.51)**:  on  your  end, 

**Speaker 1 (940.27)**:  I  guess. 

**Speaker 1 (942.69)**:  So  yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (944.39)**:  try  and  figure  it  out. 

**Speaker 1 (946.09)**:  The  mapping. 

**Speaker 2 (947.29)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (947.95)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (948.13)**:  there  does  need  to  be  one  central  place. 

**Speaker 1 (949.25)**:  I  think  everyone's  trying  to  make  one  central  place. 

**Speaker 1 (953.06)**:  We're  getting  there. 

**Speaker 1 (953.83)**:  It's  getting  better. 

**Speaker 2 (954.39)**:  So  the 

**Speaker 2 (955.79)**:  Slack  channel  is  one  of  the  main  resources. 

**Speaker 1 (958.82)**:  It's  just  for  someone  like  me  who's  in  a  10,000  or  20,000  of  them. 

**Speaker 1 (963.66)**:  But  it's  okay, 

**Speaker 1 (964.3)**:  I  manage  that. 

**Speaker 2 (965.32)**:  But  every  one  of  like  feature  channel  is  relevant  to  the  marketing. 

**Speaker 1 (971.69)**:  Yes, 

**Speaker 1 (972.03)**:  but  they  probably  don't  need  to  be  in  it  from  the  very  beginning. 

**Speaker 1 (974.65)**:  Like  for  example, 

**Speaker 1 (975.29)**:  this  one. 

**Speaker 2 (976.05)**:  How  much  time  does  it  take  to... 

**Speaker 1 (978.41)**:  It  depends, 

**Speaker 1 (979.51)**:  some  things  can  be  quite  quick  but  like  this  one  they're  not  releasing  yet, 

**Speaker 1 (982.72)**:  they're  still  working  on  developing  it. 

**Speaker 1 (985.32)**:  I  don't  believe  marketing  would  have  to  be  involved  in  this  until... 

**Speaker 1 (990.48)**:  there  should  be  a  point  where  the  PM  decides  okay  this  is  ready, 

**Speaker 1 (993.4)**:  let's  think  about  marketing. 

**Speaker 1 (995.1)**:  I  don't  know  when  that  is. 

**Speaker 2 (997.11)**:  So  I  need  to  talk  with  the  PMs  also, 

**Speaker 2 (998.83)**:  maybe  they'll  have  some... 

**Speaker 1 (1000.75)**:  Raphael  and  Rotem  because  like  I'm  in  all  these  other  ones  like... 

**Speaker 1 (1006.37)**:  It's  a  lot  of  technical  stuff  they  talk  about  for  a  long  time, 

**Speaker 1 (1010.69)**:  which  is  more  useful  for  me  because  I  need  to  understand  how  things  work, 

**Speaker 1 (1013.51)**:  I  guess. 

**Speaker 1 (1014.85)**:  But 

**Speaker 1 (1015.71)**:  I  guess  marketing  don't  need  to  know, 

**Speaker 2 (1017.84)**:  basically. 

**Speaker 1 (1020.04)**:  It's  just  too  much  spam, 

**Speaker 1 (1022.46)**:  really, 

**Speaker 1 (1022.78)**:  that's  all  I  can  say. 

**Speaker 1 (1024.5)**:  It's  just  a  lot. 

**Speaker 1 (1026.58)**:  By  the  way, 

**Speaker 1 (1027.0)**:  Ron, 

**Speaker 1 (1027.36)**:  he  usually  tells  me  when  things  are  being  released. 

**Speaker 1 (1030.32)**:  Not  always  accurate, 

**Speaker 1 (1031.12)**:  but... 

**Speaker 2 (1031.5)**:  He's  a  release  manager. 

**Speaker 2 (1032.98)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 2 (1033.2)**:  exactly. 

**Speaker 1 (1034.02)**:  So  he'll  usually  come  to  me  and  be  like, 

**Speaker 1 (1035.39)**:  this  is  coming  out  in  a  minute. 

**Speaker 2 (1037.17)**:  And  they  use  the  calendar  that  you  showed  me. 

**Speaker 2 (1040.33)**:  Should. 

**Speaker 1 (1040.51)**:  They  should. 

**Speaker 1 (1041.43)**:  They  should. 

**Speaker 1 (1042.07)**:  But  they  can't  always  stick  to  it, 

**Speaker 1 (1043.47)**:  I  guess. 

**Speaker 1 (1043.61)**:  It's  like  priorities  change. 

**Speaker 1 (1046.59)**:  I  don't  think  they  can  stick. 

**Speaker 1 (1048.93)**:  They're  very  much  like  they  move  around  their  schedule  and  the  devs  move  around  doing  different  things. 

**Speaker 1 (1052.45)**:  They  get  placed  and  do  different  things. 

**Speaker 1 (1053.71)**:  So  I  think  their  priorities  change  very  quickly. 

**Speaker 1 (1055.49)**:  So  I  don't  think... 

**Speaker 2 (1057.09)**:  How  do  you  sync  your  calendar  to  the  feature  release? 

**Speaker 2 (1059.31)**:  You  just  put  it  in  like  a... 

**Speaker 2 (1060.09)**:  I  do  it  manually. 

**Speaker 2 (1061.11)**:  manual  yeah  mine  is  manual  whenever  i  get  updates 

**Speaker 2 (1065.78)**:  yeah  what  do  you  think  can  be  automated  anything  like  in  this  process  okay  so  this  channel  that  he  made  is  good 

**Speaker 2 (1075.56)**:  where  it  says  what's  really  today  yeah 

**Speaker 1 (1077.99)**:  i  find  it  annoying  that  it  comes  at  11  a.m  though  i'd  rather  know  earlier  because  if  it's  like  releasing  today  i  need  to  be  on  it  but  then  you  see  this  was  on  monday  releasing  today  and  now  it's  being  pushed  back  till  next  week  so 

**Speaker 1 (1090.2)**:  Again, 

**Speaker 1 (1090.7)**:  it's  not  accurate. 

**Speaker 1 (1092.08)**:  It  needs  to  be  improved. 

**Speaker 2 (1093.18)**:  Homer  is? 

**Speaker 1 (1094.56)**:  He's  the  operations  guy, 

**Speaker 1 (1095.92)**:  I  think. 

**Speaker 1 (1096.36)**:  He's  new. 

**Speaker 2 (1096.7)**:  Product  also? 

**Speaker 1 (1097.88)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1098.02)**:  I  think  he's... 

**Speaker 1 (1098.74)**:  I  can't  see, 

**Speaker 1 (1099.5)**:  but... 

**Speaker 1 (1099.62)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (1099.74)**:  You  know  him? 

**Speaker 1 (1103.29)**:  Is  he  operations? 

**Speaker 2 (1104.71)**:  Product, 

**Speaker 2 (1105.11)**:  I  think. 

**Speaker 1 (1106.15)**:  Must  be. 

**Speaker 1 (1117.16)**:  So  yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1117.62)**:  so  these  channels  are  getting  there  with  these  things. 

**Speaker 2 (1121.18)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 1 (1122.16)**:  There's  also  this  one, 

**Speaker 1 (1122.94)**:  ChangeLog. 

**Speaker 1 (1125.56)**:  This  one's  really  good  because  this  is  actually  your  absenza  on  what  was  released  yesterday. 

**Speaker 1 (1132.47)**:  what  like  what's  the  date  today  my  watch  is  dead  um  so  this  was  released  yesterday  so  he  sent  it  this  morning  so  he  said  and  nobody  know  knew  about  it  i  mean  a  lot  of  the  things  it's  a  bus  thing  yeah  like  some  things  we  don't  need  to  know  about 

**Speaker 1 (1149.22)**:  but 

**Speaker 1 (1149.44)**:  some  but  sometimes  i  do  need  to  know  about  things  and  often  here  i'm  like  oh  you  didn't  tell  Tell  me  about  this. 

**Speaker 1 (1156.45)**:  So  it's  back-end  and  front-end, 

**Speaker 1 (1158.21)**:  like  this... 

**Speaker 1 (1159.73)**:  So  not  everything  is  relevant  to... 

**Speaker 1 (1162.35)**:  If  it's  marketing, 

**Speaker 1 (1162.95)**:  marketing  won't  know  about  it, 

**Speaker 1 (1163.89)**:  but... 

**Speaker 1 (1165.49)**:  But  some  things  here  are  often  relevant  to  me. 

**Speaker 2 (1168.15)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (1168.75)**:  Customization, 

**Speaker 2 (1169.49)**:  depression, 

**Speaker 2 (1170.35)**:  depression... 

**Speaker 1 (1172.31)**:  Like, 

**Speaker 1 (1172.47)**:  for  example, 

**Speaker 1 (1173.75)**:  last  week  they  released  the  workspace  settings  and  I  didn't  know, 

**Speaker 1 (1176.49)**:  and  I  was  like, 

**Speaker 1 (1176.96)**:  oh, 

**Speaker 1 (1177.12)**:  shit, 

**Speaker 1 (1177.28)**:  they  released  it  and  I  have  to  go  and  figure  it  all  out. 

**Speaker 1 (1181.52)**:  So  his  list  is  good, 

**Speaker 1 (1182.4)**:  because  he  has  the  full  list  of  everything  that's  been  released. 

**Speaker 2 (1189.83)**:  So  you  use  this  also? 

**Speaker 1 (1191.41)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1191.93)**:  this  is  really  important  to  me. 

**Speaker 1 (1193.58)**:  He  wanted  to  get  rid  of  this  and  I  was  like, 

**Speaker 1 (1194.68)**:  no, 

**Speaker 1 (1194.84)**:  I  need  it. 

**Speaker 1 (1195.5)**:  Because  even  small  things  like  mobile  experience  improvements, 

**Speaker 1 (1198.96)**:  like  I  need  to  check  that  the  documentation  matches  to  what  they've  changed. 

**Speaker 1 (1203.52)**:  They  wouldn't  necessarily  announce  this. 

**Speaker 2 (1204.86)**:  but  this  is  so  you  your  workflow  is  work  waking  up  looking  all  the  feet  I  go  through  every  single  20,000  slack  channels  fit  channel  then  you  go  and  and  then  and  then  I  have  to  prioritize  in  my  head  like  what's  coming  out  yeah  what's  that  priority  for  today  and  then  just  gathering  more  information  with  the  changelog  with  their  product  update  something  like  that  calling  it  that  if  needed  calling  your  product  if  needed  exactly 

**Speaker 2 (1232.85)**:  Gathering  information, 

**Speaker 2 (1234.11)**:  talking  with... 

**Speaker 1 (1234.63)**:  A  lot  of  multitasking. 

**Speaker 2 (1235.97)**:  Talking  with  Tiffany, 

**Speaker 2 (1236.77)**:  maybe. 

**Speaker 1 (1237.69)**:  Exactly, 

**Speaker 1 (1238.49)**:  exactly. 

**Speaker 2 (1239.51)**:  And  then  you  gather  a  document, 

**Speaker 2 (1241.35)**:  kind  of, 

**Speaker 2 (1241.85)**:  and... 

**Speaker 1 (1242.33)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (1242.69)**:  Improve  it  till  the  launch  day. 

**Speaker 1 (1244.69)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (1246.3)**:  Something  like  that. 

**Speaker 1 (1246.8)**:  I  usually  have, 

**Speaker 1 (1247.26)**:  like, 

**Speaker 1 (1247.92)**:  one  day  warning, 

**Speaker 1 (1248.62)**:  just  so  you  know. 

**Speaker 1 (1249.16)**:  Two  days  warning. 

**Speaker 1 (1250.7)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (1250.82)**:  it  depends, 

**Speaker 1 (1251.28)**:  no, 

**Speaker 1 (1251.38)**:  it  depends. 

**Speaker 1 (1251.92)**:  Like, 

**Speaker 1 (1252.66)**:  the  idea... 

**Speaker 2 (1253.82)**:  Like, 

**Speaker 1 (1254.22)**:  This  week, 

**Speaker 1 (1254.6)**:  no, 

**Speaker 1 (1254.74)**:  I  think  it's  specifically  these  two  weeks  are  different, 

**Speaker 1 (1257.18)**:  because  I've  released  so  many  things. 

**Speaker 2 (1259.17)**:  The  MCP  integration, 

**Speaker 2 (1260.81)**:  you  know... 

**Speaker 1 (1261.71)**:  about  it  no  he's  there  releasing  it  now  and  I  haven't  finished  it  up  no  now  I'm  releasing  it  like  it's  ready  like  it's  I  just  asked  him  questions  I  need  to  finalize  some  stuff  I'm  asking  about  their  credits  he  gave  me  some  feedback  on  the 

**Speaker 1 (1277.56)**:  release 

**Speaker 1 (1277.92)**:  date  today  how  do  you  know  yeah  this  was  last  night  can  we  launch  all  that's  a  fix  there  is  out  of  office 

**Speaker 1 (1289.32)**:  I'm  out  of  office  today, 

**Speaker 1 (1290.26)**:  maybe  we  ought  to  find  time  tomorrow. 

**Speaker 1 (1292.01)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 1 (1293.13)**:  I'm  guessing  it's  going  to  be  released  today. 

**Speaker 2 (1294.99)**:  How  are  you  going  to  know? 

**Speaker 1 (1296.7)**:  Well, 

**Speaker 1 (1296.84)**:  he  sends  it  tomorrow. 

**Speaker 2 (1299.32)**:  Like  what's  your  little  thing  that  tells  you? 

**Speaker 2 (1302.22)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (1302.42)**:  they'll  tell  me  when  it's  launched, 

**Speaker 1 (1303.57)**:  I'll  write  on  it. 

**Speaker 1 (1304.25)**:  We've  launched. 

**Speaker 1 (1306.11)**:  And  then  I  have  to  really  make  sure  that  I  get  everything  ready. 

**Speaker 1 (1309.61)**:  Sometimes  I  just  wait  for  the  we've  launched  comment. 

**Speaker 1 (1311.39)**:  No, 

**Speaker 2 (1311.47)**:  because  the  marketing  team  doesn't  know  about  this, 

**Speaker 2 (1313.83)**:  let's  say. 

**Speaker 1 (1314.35)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1314.49)**:  but  it's  on  this  calendar. 

**Speaker 1 (1316.99)**:  Like  they  will  know  if  they  have  to  make  an  announcement. 

**Speaker 1 (1318.88)**:  No, 

**Speaker 1 (1319.12)**:  why  is  that  stupid? 

**Speaker 1 (1321.7)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1322.98)**:  they're  not  making  an  announcement  on  it. 

**Speaker 1 (1326.66)**:  Maybe  next  week. 

**Speaker 1 (1328.77)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1329.29)**:  they've  got  their  announcement  ready. 

**Speaker 1 (1332.03)**:  So  they  do  know, 

**Speaker 1 (1334.01)**:  these  ones  are  the  marketing  activity, 

**Speaker 1 (1335.43)**:  they  do  know  that  they're  making  an  announcement  on  it. 

**Speaker 2 (1341.53)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 1 (1341.85)**:  Yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (1344.42)**:  Also  when  they  release  something  they  usually  send  it  on  like  albanese  44  or  something  if  it's  something  big  they  usually  send  it  on 

**Speaker 1 (1353.39)**:  here 

**Speaker 1 (1355.32)**:  maybe 

**Speaker 2 (1360.61)**:  yeah  i  haven't  seen  it  anywhere  just  hearing  in  the  on  the  corridors  so  many  channels  seriously 

**Speaker 2 (1368.33)**:  well  maybe  they  just  announce  it  on  product  this  one  they  usually  announce  it  on 

**Speaker 2 (1373.91)**:  yeah  let's 

**Speaker 1 (1375.43)**:  find  one  that's  been  released 

**Speaker 1 (1378.77)**:  here  on  monday 

**Speaker 1 (1381.8)**:  base  would  feel  back  end  it's  live  so  they  usually  announce  it  on  here 

**Speaker 1 (1393.42)**:  And  then  they  usually  send  a  doc  as  well  so  everyone  can  read  about  it. 

**Speaker 2 (1395.65)**:  This  is  your  doc? 

**Speaker 1 (1397.33)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1397.47)**:  this  specific  one  is  the  tech  writer's  doc, 

**Speaker 1 (1398.99)**:  but  yes, 

**Speaker 1 (1399.31)**:  it's  usually 

**Speaker 1 (1400.87)**:  the  doc. 

**Speaker 1 (1403.94)**:  They  don't  always  send  it. 

**Speaker 2 (1405.1)**:  Like  the  timeline  is... 

**Speaker 1 (1406.9)**:  They  don't  always  have  it. 

**Speaker 1 (1407.81)**:  For  example, 

**Speaker 1 (1408.17)**:  they  released  this  one  and  I  hadn't  published. 

**Speaker 1 (1410.39)**:  So  then  when  it  was  published, 

**Speaker 1 (1412.55)**:  I  sent  the  doc. 

**Speaker 1 (1413.19)**:  Because  support  needed, 

**Speaker 1 (1415.73)**:  they  need  to  read  it  to  learn  about  it. 

**Speaker 2 (1417.13)**:  So  sometimes  they... 

**Speaker 1 (1419.81)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1419.94)**:  there's  sometimes  a  delay. 

**Speaker 1 (1422.02)**:  I  mean, 

**Speaker 1 (1422.28)**:  they  release  things  at  like  7pm  at  night  and  I'm  with  my  kids. 

**Speaker 1 (1424.8)**:  So  maybe  at  like  10pm  I'll  get  to  it. 

**Speaker 1 (1429.14)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1432.01)**:  yeah. 

**Speaker 2 (1433.45)**:  So  what  do  you  think? 

**Speaker 2 (1435.5)**:  How, 

**Speaker 2 (1435.83)**:  where, 

**Speaker 2 (1436.25)**:  where? 

**Speaker 1 (1436.51)**:  Well  I  think  these  should  all  be  combined. 

**Speaker 2 (1441.72)**:  Cool. 

**Speaker 1 (1442.22)**:  Like  there's  just  too  many  channels. 

**Speaker 2 (1445.14)**:  How  did, 

**Speaker 2 (1445.56)**:  how  did  you  order? 

**Speaker 1 (1447.26)**:  Yeah  so  these  are  like, 

**Speaker 1 (1448.08)**:  these  are  the  ones  that  they  usually  put  updates  in  when  things  are  released. 

**Speaker 2 (1451.68)**:  You  did  like  uh, 

**Speaker 1 (1453.34)**:  oh  how  to  make  uh, 

**Speaker 1 (1454.62)**:  like  a  favorite. 

**Speaker 1 (1455.9)**:  You  make, 

**Speaker 1 (1456.42)**:  you  do  like  right  click  and  then  create  a  section. 

**Speaker 1 (1460.91)**:  So  these  are  the  updates, 

**Speaker 1 (1462.73)**:  are  the  most  important  ones. 

**Speaker 1 (1464.28)**:  These  are  all  the  things  that  are  being  released. 

**Speaker 1 (1465.9)**:  When  it's  being  released, 

**Speaker 1 (1466.74)**:  I  move  it  to  release  features. 

**Speaker 1 (1468.54)**:  Because  often, 

**Speaker 1 (1469.36)**:  like  this  one, 

**Speaker 1 (1470.26)**:  it's  still  comments  and  stuff. 

**Speaker 1 (1471.4)**:  My 

**Speaker 1 (1473.7)**:  general  stuff, 

**Speaker 1 (1474.4)**:  I  have  all  the  docs  channels, 

**Speaker 1 (1476.84)**:  all  the  support  channels, 

**Speaker 1 (1477.98)**:  all  the  dev  channels. 

**Speaker 1 (1479.74)**:  I  have  to  be  very  organized. 

**Speaker 2 (1484.77)**:  The  dev  has  more  channels  than  the  dev  one? 

**Speaker 1 (1489.01)**:  I  like  reading  that  there's  yeah  there's  definitely  more  there's  main  one  um 

**Speaker 1 (1495.71)**:  I  like  this  one  because  sometimes  I  see  things  in  here  that  I  need  to  add  to  the  docs  wow  I  also  have  to  monitor  like  if  I  see  something  then  this  one  yeah  it's  called  devs  yeah  yeah  um  this 

**Speaker 1 (1511.44)**:  one  isn't  so  relevant  I  just  like  yeah 

**Speaker 1 (1515.12)**:  but  Thank  you. 

**Speaker 2 (1516.5)**:  You  get  some  information  there. 

**Speaker 1 (1518.82)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1519.14)**:  it's  also  like  here, 

**Speaker 1 (1520.2)**:  what  was  this? 

**Speaker 1 (1521.54)**:  Oh, 

**Speaker 1 (1521.74)**:  it's  a  dinner, 

**Speaker 1 (1522.4)**:  and  oh, 

**Speaker 1 (1522.89)**:  they  tagged  me  on  this. 

**Speaker 1 (1523.9)**:  There  was  like  something  missing, 

**Speaker 1 (1525.25)**:  there  was  a  404  error. 

**Speaker 1 (1527.33)**:  So  like, 

**Speaker 1 (1527.69)**:  I'm  in  this  channel  because  the  devs  use 

**Speaker 1 (1531.77)**:  it. 

**Speaker 1 (1531.95)**:  And  not  so  important  though. 

**Speaker 2 (1535.35)**:  Cool. 

**Speaker 2 (1536.25)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 1 (1537.79)**:  So  yeah. 

**Speaker 1 (1540.11)**:  Welcome  to  my  life. 

**Speaker 1 (1541.75)**:  I  need  an  assistant. 

**Speaker 1 (1544.85)**:  A  private  system. 

**Speaker 2 (1546.1)**:  Yeah, 

**Speaker 2 (1546.4)**:  but  you're  well  organized. 

**Speaker 2 (1548.3)**:  First  time  I  saw  a  system 

**Speaker 2 (1550.82)**:  in  this  week. 

**Speaker 2 (1553.42)**:  Only  one  week  here, 

**Speaker 2 (1554.42)**:  yeah? 

**Speaker 1 (1555.14)**:  Ah, 

**Speaker 1 (1555.44)**:  welcome, 

**Speaker 2 (1555.9)**:  welcome. 

**Speaker 1 (1557.24)**:  Did  you  come  from  Wix? 

**Speaker 2 (1559.45)**:  No. 

**Speaker 1 (1559.73)**:  So  I  came  from  Wix. 

**Speaker 1 (1561.09)**:  I've  been  here  for  12  years. 

**Speaker 2 (1562.17)**:  Okay. 

**Speaker 1 (1562.77)**:  So  I  understand  how  these  things  work. 

**Speaker 1 (1565.19)**:  And  in  Wix, 

**Speaker 1 (1566.05)**:  we're  a  much  bigger  writing  team. 

**Speaker 1 (1567.03)**:  We  have  like  40  people. 

**Speaker 2 (1570.09)**:  And  it's  different? 

**Speaker 1 (1570.52)**:  And  it's  a  chargeable  system. 

**Speaker 2 (1572.7)**:  What's  that? 

**Speaker 1 (1573.78)**:  I  was  in  charge  of 

**Speaker 1 (1575.96)**:  managing  the  team. 

**Speaker 2 (1577.0)**:  So  you  do  it  differently  there? 

**Speaker 1 (1579.18)**:  Is  there  a  system  in  place? 

**Speaker 1 (1582.52)**:  You'd  be  surprised, 

**Speaker 1 (1583.23)**:  it's  taken  us  a  long  time. 

**Speaker 1 (1585.23)**:  But  I  think  in  general, 

**Speaker 1 (1587.11)**:  in  Wix  we  had  a  lot  more  time. 

**Speaker 1 (1589.39)**:  We'd  be  given  three  months  notice  and  it  was  coming  out. 

**Speaker 1 (1592.09)**:  Here  it's  three  days. 

**Speaker 1 (1595.25)**:  But  that's  the  startup  vibe. 

**Speaker 1 (1596.93)**:  I  prefer  it. 

**Speaker 1 (1598.99)**:  But  yeah, 

**Speaker 1 (1599.72)**:  with  so  many  stakeholders  we  had  lots  of  systems  in  place. 

**Speaker 1 (1602.99)**:  yeah  thanks  so  much  it  was  really  valuable  i'm  here  for  any  questions  thanks  a  lot  i'm  probably  the  most  organized  person  in  this  company  what's  that  i'm  the  most  organized  person  here  the  most 

**Speaker 1 (1691.24)**:  Thank  you.
