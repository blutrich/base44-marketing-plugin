## 13 Core Anti-AI Patterns

### Pattern 1: AI uses the same words every time
- **Banned verbs:** leverage, utilize, delve, craft, garner, elevate, amplify, spearhead, streamline, curate, harness, cultivate, navigate, facilitate, embark, empower, bolster
- **Banned adjectives:** groundbreaking, cutting-edge, innovative, robust, seamless, scalable, transformative, unprecedented, dynamic, holistic, comprehensive, compelling, remarkable, pivotal, crucial, meticulous, multifaceted, profound, vibrant, vital
- **Banned adverbs:** drastically, genuinely, remarkably, significantly, strategically, substantially, profoundly, meticulously, notably, truly
- **Banned abstract nouns:** paradigm, ecosystem, landscape, synergy, framework, catalyst, cornerstone, deep dive, game-changer, optimization, transformation, intersection, tapestry, interplay, intricacies

### Pattern 2: AI is obsessed with the number 3
- Groups everything in threes (adjectives, bullet points, parallel phrases)
- Rule: if you spot a trio, cut to two or expand. Two is almost always enough.

### Pattern 3: The "it's not X, it's Y" sentence
- All contrast framing banned: "It's not about X. It's about Y."
- Including escalation: "It's not A. It's not even B. It's actually C."
- Just say what you mean directly.

### Pattern 4: Em dashes everywhere
- AI loves em dashes (—). Replace with commas, periods, or parentheses.

### Pattern 5: Dramatic short sentences stacked
- "They launched. They failed. They learned. They grew."
- Sounds like a movie trailer. Break them up, vary rhythm.

### Pattern 6: AI narrates its own writing
- Before points: "Here's why this matters." "The key takeaway is."
- After points: "This highlights..." "This underscores..."
- Between points: "The kicker?" "The bottom line?"
- Delete narration, add specific details instead.

### Pattern 7: "Nobody tells you this"
- "Nobody talks about this." "Nobody tells you this secret."
- Avoid "nobody" as dramatic opener — feels manipulative.

### Pattern 8: Giving everything a fake name
- "The Growth Paradox." "The 5-Step Framework." "The SMART Method."
- If it doesn't have a real name, don't capitalize or prefix with "The".

### Pattern 9: AI sprays the same emojis everywhere
- Banned emojis: 🚀 💡 🎯 ✅ 🔥 💪 🌟 ✨ 📈 🏆 💎 🔑 🎉 ⚡ 🌐 📊 🤝 💼 🧠 🔒 ⭐ 📌 👉 🛠️ 📢 🔷 💠 🪄 ⚙️ 🎁 💰 🧩 🏅 📍 🔔 💬 📝 🎓 🌱 💥
- AI uses emojis as bullet points/decoration. Humans use them occasionally.

### Pattern 10: Same transition words
- Banned openers: However, Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally, Nevertheless, Notably, Indeed, Consequently, Accordingly, Fundamentally, Essentially, Inherently, Particularly

### Pattern 11: Significance inflation
- "Marking a pivotal moment..." "Setting the stage for..." "A testament to..."
- If it matters, say why with specifics. Don't announce importance.

### Pattern 12: -ing phrases that add zero meaning
- "...highlighting the importance of innovation"
- "...underscoring the need for data-driven strategies"
- Just state the fact. If analysis matters, make it a new sentence with specifics.

### Pattern 13: AI is allergic to the word "is"
- "This serves as a powerful solution" → "This is useful"
- "The platform boasts a comprehensive analytics suite" → "The platform has a dashboard"
- Replace serves/stands/functions as → is. Replace boasts/features/offers → has.

## Content Patterns to Remove

## Language Patterns to Remove
- **Copula avoidance:** Use "is" and "has" instead of fancy substitutes
- **-ing phrase padding:** Remove participial phrases added for fake depth
- **Contrast framing:** All "it's not X, it's Y" variants banned
- **Synonym cycling:** Pick one term and stick with it
- **False ranges:** Remove "from X to Y" where X/Y aren't a real spectrum
- **Rule-of-three:** Use two when two is enough
- **Fake naming:** Don't capitalize ordinary ideas

## Style Patterns to Remove
- **Boldface abuse:** Don't mechanically bold key terms
- **Vertical lists with inline headers:** Use normal sentences
- **Title case:** Use sentence case for headings
- **Curly quotes:** Use straight quotes

## How to Add Voice Back (After Removing Patterns)
1. Have actual opinions — "I don't love this approach" > balanced analysis
2. Write in first person — "I've tested this" > "Studies show"
3. Be specific about feelings — not "concerning" but describe what's weird
4. Leave some mess — half-formed thoughts, asides, "I'm not sure"
5. Vary rhythm — short then long then short. Same length = generated.
