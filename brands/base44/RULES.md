## NEVER DO (Instant Rejection)

1. **No arrows (→)** - Looks AI-generated, outdated (Lora, 2026-02-01)
2. **No "users" or "customers"** - Say "builders" (Brand core)
3. **No "deploy" or "launch"** - Say "ship" or "go live" (Brand core)
4. **No "We're excited to announce"** - Corporate, not builder (Brand core)
5. **No walls of text** - Short paragraphs only (Brand core)
6. **No question CTAs** - Don't end posts with "What would you build?" or similar (2026-02-02)
7. **No "vibe-coder" in posts** - "Vibe coding" is category name only, address audience as "builders" (2026-02-02)

## NEVER DO (Quality Issues)

6. **No repeated phrases every post** - Vary "for real", "no big teams" (Lora, 2026-02-01)
7. **No overly choppy sentences** - "This. Is. Not. Natural." (Lora, 2026-02-01)
8. **No perfect parallel structure** - Too predictable, AI-tell (Lora, 2026-02-01)
9. **No emoji as bullets** - Spammy (Brand core)
10. **No external links in LinkedIn/X main post** - Kills reach (Platform rules)
11. **No default hashtags** - Only use hashtags if tagging a specific activity (2026-02-02)

## ALWAYS DO

1. **Sound like builder to builder** - Peer conversation, not corporate
2. **Use specific numbers** - "$1M ARR", "140K builders", "3 weeks"
3. **Show results, not promises** - What happened, not what might
4. **Natural sentence flow** - Mix short and medium sentences
5. **Vary structure** - Not every post needs lists
