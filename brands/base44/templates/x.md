## Single Tweet Structures

### Hot Take
```
[Bold observation or claim]

[Quick proof or context]
```

**Example:**
```
Most no-code tools make you slower, not faster.

Too many features. Too much complexity.

Build something simple that works. That's it.
```

### Feature Announcement
```
Just shipped: [Feature name]

[What it does in one line]

Build yours → (link in reply)
```

**Example:**
```
Just shipped: AI-powered database schema generation

Describe your data. Get a working schema in seconds.

Build yours → (link in reply) 🧪
```

### Builder Spotlight
```
[Builder] shipped [app] in [timeframe].

[Specific result]

Here's how:
```

**Example:**
```
@buildername shipped a CRM in 2 weeks.

Now at $3K MRR with 45 paying customers.

Started with zero code experience. Here's what worked 👇
```

### Quick Tip
```
[Problem most people have]

[Simple solution]

[Optional: where to learn more]
```

**Example:**
```
Your app doesn't need a dashboard on day 1.

Ship the core feature. Add analytics later.

Your users want the thing, not the thing about the thing.
```

## Thread Structures

### Story Thread
```
🧵 Tweet 1: [Dramatic outcome or hook]

Tweet 2: [Where it started]

Tweet 3-5: [What happened]

Tweet 6: [The turning point]

Tweet 7: [Lesson learned]

Tweet 8: [CTA + follow prompt]
```

**Example:**
```
🧵 A builder just hit $10K MRR.

8 months ago, they had zero coding experience.

Here's the full story:

2/ They started with a problem: tracking inventory for their small bakery.

Spreadsheets were chaos. Existing software was overkill.

3/ So they built their own app. In 3 weeks.

Nothing fancy. Just:
- Inventory tracking
- Low stock alerts
- Simple reports

4/ Then something unexpected happened.

Other bakery owners asked for access.

"Can I use that?" became their first 5 customers.

5/ The turning point: They stopped adding features.

Instead, they talked to users.

Every improvement came from real feedback, not assumptions.

6/ Now: 47 paying customers. $10K MRR.

No VC. No team. No code.

7/ The lesson:

You don't need permission to build.
You don't need a CS degree.
You don't need the perfect idea.

You need a problem you understand.

🧵 How to validate an app idea in 48 hours (without writing code)

Most people spend months building something nobody wants.

Here's how to avoid that:

2/ Step 1: Write the landing page first

Not the app. The page that sells the app.

If you can't explain the value in 3 sentences, you're not ready.

3/ Step 2: Find 10 people with the problem

Not friends. Real potential users.

Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn communities.

Ask: "What's your biggest frustration with [X]?"

4/ Step 3: Show them the landing page

Don't explain it. Watch them read it.

Where do they pause? What questions do they ask?

5/ Step 4: Ask for money (or time)

"Would you pay $X/month for this?"

"Would you sign up for early access?"

Real commitment > polite interest.

6/ Common mistakes:
- Asking "Would you use this?" (everyone says yes)
- Only talking to friends (too nice)
- Building before validating (expensive lesson)

7/ The 48-hour test:

If you can't find 10 people excited about your solution in 2 days, pivot.

That's the signal.
