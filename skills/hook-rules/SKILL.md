# Hook Creation Rules

Rules for creating engaging, on-brand hooks that avoid AI-detection patterns.

## What We DON'T Use

| Banned Pattern | Why | Example |
|----------------|-----|---------|
| Contrarian hooks | We don't need to be "against" something to stand out | "Stop doing X..." |
| FOMO tactics | No fear-based urgency | "Don't miss out", "Before it's too late" |
| Negative framing | We lead with possibility, not problems | "You're doing it wrong" |
| Arrow bullets (→, ➡️, ▸) | Creates a cold, listicle feel - AI detection flag | "→ Feature one" |
| "We're excited to announce" | Corporate speak | Any variation |

## What We DO Use

### Formatting Rules
- Emojis only for bullet points and emphasis
- Clean, warm visual style
- Positive, builder-focused energy
- No arrows - use emoji bullets instead

### 5 Approved Hook Styles

#### 1. Result-First
Lead with the outcome, then explain.

```
$350K saved.
One app.
Built in a weekend.
```

#### 2. Builder Spotlight
Feature a real person's achievement.

```
Sarah launched her SaaS yesterday.
No code. No investors. Just Base44.
```

#### 3. Possibility Hook
Ask "what if" to spark imagination.

```
What if your next idea was live by Friday?
```

#### 4. Social Proof
Show momentum through numbers.

```
12 apps launched this week.
Here's what they built:
```

#### 5. Direct Value
Punchy, benefit-focused statements.

```
Ship faster. Iterate faster. Win faster.
```

## Approved Emoji Bullets

Use these instead of arrows:

| Emoji | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| ✅ | Completed items, features included |
| 🚀 | Launches, speed, momentum |
| 💡 | Ideas, insights, tips |
| 🔥 | Hot takes, exciting news |
| ⚡ | Speed, instant results |
| 🎯 | Goals, accuracy, targeting |
| 💪 | Empowerment, capability |
| 🛠️ | Building, tools, creation |

## Examples

### ❌ Wrong (Contrarian + FOMO + Arrows)
```
Stop wasting time on code that doesn't matter.
→ Your competitors are already shipping faster
→ Don't get left behind
→ The window is closing
```

### ✅ Right (Positive + Emoji + Builder-focused)
```
Ship your idea this week.

🛠️ Visual builder for everything
⚡ Deploy in one click
🚀 Real customers by Friday

Your turn.
```

## Hook Validation Checklist

Before using any hook, verify:

1. [ ] No arrow bullets (→ ➡️ ▸)
2. [ ] No FOMO language ("don't miss", "before it's too late", "left behind")
3. [ ] No negative framing ("stop wasting", "you're doing it wrong")
4. [ ] No contrarian angle for its own sake
5. [ ] Leads with outcome, not problem
6. [ ] Uses approved emoji set for bullets
7. [ ] Sounds like a builder talking to a builder

## Integration with Agents

When linkedin-specialist, x-specialist, or copywriter generates hooks:

```
1. Generate hook using approved styles
2. Check against banned patterns list
3. Validate no arrow bullets present
4. Ensure positive framing
5. Use approved emoji set for bullets
6. Lead with outcomes, not problems
```

## Quick Reference Card

```
NEVER:
❌ Contrarian angles
❌ FOMO urgency
❌ Negative framing
❌ Arrow bullets (→ ➡️ ▸)
❌ "We're excited to announce"

ALWAYS:
✅ Positive, possibility-focused
✅ Emoji bullets only
✅ Builder-first messaging
✅ Lead with outcomes
✅ Specific numbers when possible
```

## Channel-Specific Hook Rules

### LinkedIn
- Hook must stop the scroll in 2 seconds
- First line under 150 characters
- Question hooks work well for engagement
- Numbers in first line boost CTR

### X (Twitter)
- Hook IS the tweet for single posts
- Thread hooks: intrigue without clickbait
- "The results were honestly shocking" style works
- Numbered threads (1/) signal more coming

### Email
- Subject line = hook (under 50 chars)
- Preview text extends the hook (90 chars)
- Curiosity + benefit combo works best
