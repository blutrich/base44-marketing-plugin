## Strategy 1: Employee Advocacy (Spoon-Feeding Method)

### The Problem
Employees don't know what to post, fear saying wrong thing, content feels like work.

### The Solution: Spoon-Feed Everything

**Create Content Kit:**
- Pre-written posts (2-3 options per announcement)
- Images sized for LinkedIn
- Suggested hashtags
- Best times to post

**Make It Embarrassingly Easy:**
```
Hey team, we're launching [X] tomorrow!

OPTION A (excited):
"Just shipped [feature]! Been working on this for months and I'm pumped. [Link]"

OPTION B (story-focused):
"Remember when [problem]? We just solved it. [Link]"

OPTION C (casual):
"This is cool - [brief description]. [Link]"

Pick your favorite, personalize, post tomorrow!
```

**Job Title Hack:** 50 employees change titles = 50 notification blasts

1. Dwell time (people stop to read)
2. Early engagement (comments in first hour)
3. Conversation (back-and-forth)

- "[X] changed how I think about [Y]"

### Formatting
- Short paragraphs (1-2 lines)
- White space between ideas
- Number lists (3-5 items)
- Link in comments, not post

3. Final: CTA + who you are

```
"What's your biggest challenge with [topic]?"
A) Option 1

D) Other (comment!)
```
