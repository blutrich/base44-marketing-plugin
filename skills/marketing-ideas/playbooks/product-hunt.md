# Product Hunt Dominance Playbook

> "Product Hunt isn't won on launch day - it's won in the 8 weeks before."

## The Reality

### What Most Get Wrong
1. Thinking launch day matters (80% determined before)
2. Focusing on product, not people
3. Asking for upvotes cold (spam)

### What Actually Wins
- **Relationship density:** How many PHunters know you?
- **Reciprocity debt:** How many people "owe" you?
- **Community standing:** Are you known for giving?

---

## Weeks 1-2: Research

### Goal: 200+ active PH community members

**Build target list with:**
- Name, PH Username
- Twitter/X, LinkedIn
- What they've launched/hunted
- Notes

**Target Categories:**
| Category | Why | # to Find |

| Prolific Hunters | Can hunt your product | 20 |
| Successful Makers | Reciprocate | 50 |
| Active Commenters | Engaged | 100 |
| Rising Stars | Motivated | 30+ |

---

## Weeks 3-4: Initial Outreach

### Daily 20-Minute Routine

**Minutes 0-10: PH Activity**
- Upvote 3-5 products genuinely
- Leave 2-3 thoughtful comments
- Follow 5 interesting makers

**Minutes 10-20: Maker Outreach**
- Find someone who launched recently
- Use/review their product
- Send DM with specific feedback

### Initial DM Template
```
Hey [Name]!

Just saw [Product] - [specific thing you liked].

Quick question: [genuine question about launch]

I'm building [one sentence], so learning from
how others approach this.

Congrats!
```

## Weeks 5-6: Deepening Relationships

### The Reciprocity Trap
Help makers when most vulnerable (during launch). They'll return favor.

**When Someone Launches:**
- Be first to comment (substantive)
- Share on all social channels
- Reply to others' comments
- Send DM with support offer

**Post-Launch DM:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Congrats on [Product] launch!

Anything I can do to help amplify?
- Share to my [X] followers
- Post in [relevant community]
- Write up a quick review

Just let me know!
```

### Relationship Levels
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Stranger |
| 1 | They replied once |
| 2 | Multiple exchanges |
| 3 | Would help each other |
| 4 | Actively promotes you |

**Goal:** 30+ people at Level 2-3 before launch
