> "Creativity isn't magic - it's a system."

**I**dentify → **D**ecode → **E**xtract → **A**pply

---

## Overview

| Stage | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **I**dentify | Find high-signal sources | List of interesting tactics |
| **D**ecode | Reverse-engineer what works | Understanding of WHY |
| **E**xtract | Pull out generic ingredients | Reusable patterns |
| **A**pply | Fuse with your assets | Tailored tactics |

---

## Stage 1: IDENTIFY

### High-Signal Sources

1. **Google Alerts** - "[Competitor] marketing", "[Industry] viral campaign"
2. **Product Hunt** - Top launches, maker comments, taglines
3. **Hyper-Growth Companies** - Ramp, Notion, Figma, Linear
4. **r/InternetIsBeautiful** - Interactive experiences that go viral
5. **Ad Libraries** - Facebook, TikTok, Google (90+ days = proven)
6. **Case Study Sources** - marketingexamples.com, Really Good Emails

### Your Identify Ritual

**Weekly (15 min):**
- Check Google Alerts
- Scan Product Hunt top 5
- Save 3 interesting tactics

**Monthly (30 min):**
- Deep-dive one hyper-growth company
- Review competitor ad libraries

---

## Stage 2: DECODE

### Decoding Questions

1. **What problem does this solve?**
2. **Why did it spread?**
3. **What's the mechanism?**
4. **What constraints did they work within?**

### Decode Template

```
TACTIC: [Name]
SOURCE: [Where found]
COMPANY: [Who did it]

PROBLEM SOLVED:
[What need did this meet?]

MECHANISM:
[Step-by-step how it works]

WHY IT SPREAD:
[Virality factors]

KEY INSIGHT:
[The one thing that makes this work]
```

---

## Stage 3: EXTRACT

### Process

1. **Remove brand-specific elements**
   "Spotify Wrapped" → "Annual personalized review with shareable results"

2. **Identify core pattern**
   What category? What psychological trigger?

3. **Name the pattern**
   "The Public Commitment Play", "The Visible Effort Signal"

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Progress Visualization | Show users their journey |
| Social Proof Cascade | Others doing it = I should |
| Curiosity Gap | Promise of hidden info |
| Effort Signaling | Show the work |
| Status Upgrade | Make users feel special |
| Scarcity Trigger | Limited availability |
| Reciprocity Trap | Give first, ask later |
| Identity Reinforcement | "People like you..." |

---

## Stage 4: APPLY

### Your Assets (USED Framework)

**U - Users**
- Who are they?
- What communities?
- What do they share?
- What makes them look good?

**S - Stories**
- Founding story
- Customer transformations
- Behind-the-scenes
- Failures and recoveries

**E - Employees**
- Personal brands
- Unique expertise
- Networks
- Authentic voices

**D - Data/Features**
- Unique data
- Features competitors lack
- Usage patterns
- Aggregate insights

### Fusion Exercise

1. **Pick pattern:** "Annual personalized review with shareable results"
2. **Map assets:** Users = developers, Data = API stats
3. **Create tactic:** "Developer Wrapped: Annual email with API stats, shareable card"
4. **ICE Score it**

---

## ICE Scoring

### The Scale (1-10)

**Impact:** How big if it works?
- 10: Company-changing
- 7-9: Significant business impact
- 4-6: Moderate improvement
- 1-3: Incremental gains

**Confidence:** How sure it will work?
- 10: Proven tactic
- 7-9: Similar tactics worked
- 4-6: Logical hypothesis
- 1-3: Experimental

**Ease:** How easy to execute?
- 10: One person, one day
- 7-9: One person, one week
- 4-6: Small team, few weeks
- 1-3: Large effort

**Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3**

### Prioritization

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| High ICE + Quick | Do immediately |
| High ICE + Hard | Plan carefully |
| Medium ICE + Easy | Batch these |
| Low ICE | Skip or save |
