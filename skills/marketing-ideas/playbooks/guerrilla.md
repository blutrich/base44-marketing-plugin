# Guerrilla Marketing & Moonshot Philosophy

> "The best marketing tactics have one thing in common: AI can't do any of them."

## The Moonshot Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. 24-Hour Execution**
If you can't ship in 24 hours, it's too complicated.

**2. Asymmetric ROI**
$500 spend → $50,000 earned media
1 hour work → weeks of attention

**3. AI-Proof Marketing**
Focus on: genuine relationships, physical presence, authentic weirdness, real vulnerability.

### The Moonshot Test
1. Can I do this in 24 hours? → If no, simplify
2. Is upside 10x+ the effort? → If no, skip
3. Could AI replicate this? → If yes, it's not a moat

## Guerrilla Tactics

### 1. Email to Billboard (Loops Strategy)
Screenshot email/digital product, put on physical media.
**Cost:** $100-1000
**Reach:** Local + viral social + earned media

### 2. Event Hijacking ($500 vs $1M)
Host counter-event nearby instead of $50K booth.
- $3K dinner with 30 decision-makers > $50K booth
- More deals closed than booth

**Steps:**
1. Book venue nearby
2. Invite targets 2-3 weeks before
3. Create memorable experience
4. Don't sell - build relationships

### 3. The Accidental Email
Emails that appear to be mistakes generate curiosity.

**"Oops Wrong List":**
```
Subject: Fwd: quick thought
Wait, this was supposed to go to [colleague].
Since you're here though...
```

**"Leaked Preview":**
```
Subject: INTERNAL: Draft for review
Don't share this yet...
Oh no, this wasn't meant to go out yet.
```

### 4. The Phone Hotline Demo
Create callable phone number. The call IS the demo.
- Bland AI: Billboard + phone = 5% conversion
**Cost:** $50-500/month

### 5. Engineering-as-Marketing
Build free tools attracting target audience.

| Tool | Company | Strategy |
|------|---------|----------|
| Website Grader | HubSpot | Grade → CRM value |
| Headline Analyzer | CoSchedule | Analyze → upsell |

**24-Hour Build:** Build in Typeform/Spreadsheet first, test with 10 people.

### 6. The Fake Job Title Blast
Coordinate LinkedIn title changes. 50 employees = 50 notification surges.
**Cost:** Free
**Reach:** 10,000s impressions

### 7. The Niche Absurdity Play
"The first CRM for left-handed dentists."
Absurdity = shareable + SEO long-tail.

### 8. The Visible Labor Signal
Show the work, not just result.
- "Hand-selected by team of 12"
- "Reviewed 500 applications"
- "8 months of research"

### 9. Competitor Intelligence Hack

**Google Dorking:**
```
"[competitor] sucks" site:reddit.com
"looking for [competitor] alternative"
site:g2.com "[competitor]" "cons"
```

**Ad Library Intelligence:**
Sort by longest running = working ads.

### 10. Mini-Game Launch
Wordle-style reveals, interactive experiences.
**Tool:** Outgrow, Involve.me, Typeform

## AI-Proof Test

**AI CAN do:**
- Write copy variations
- Generate images
- Analyze data
- Automate sequences

**AI CANNOT do:**
- Build genuine relationships
- Show up physically
- Make taste judgments
- Create authentic weirdness
- Take real risks
- Be vulnerable

**If AI can do it, it's not a moat.**

## Mindset Principles

1. **Constraints Are Features** - Low budget forces creativity
2. **Speed > Polish** - Weird idea shipped today > perfect campaign next quarter
3. **Measure in Stories** - "Did this create a story someone would tell?"
4. **Fail Small, Learn Fast** - 10 tiny experiments > 1 big bet
5. **Human > Scale** - One great relationship > 1000 impressions
6. **Weird Is Memorable** - Safe is forgettable
7. **Give Before You Ask** - Reciprocity follows
