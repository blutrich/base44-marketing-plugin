### 2026-01-31 - Multi-channel - Debug Mode Launch (Tiffany)

**Source:** Tier 1 feature launch marketing plan

**Content Structure (LinkedIn/X):**
> When something in your app isn't working, the hardest part is often figuring out why (and how to fix it) - especially when there's no clear error.
>
> Now, you can just tell Base44: "something is wrong" or "I have an issue".
>
> We'll gather the context, pinpoint what happened, and help you get to the fix - no explanation needed.
> So you spend less time guessing and more time shipping.

**Content Structure (Discord - more casual):**
> Getting unstuck just got WAY easier 💪
>
> When something in your app isn't working, the hardest part is figuring out why ESPECIALLY when there's no clear error.
>
> Now you can just say "something is wrong." We'll gather the context, pinpoint what happened, and help you get to the fix, no long explanation needed.
>
> Less guessing. More shipping. 💪
>
> Tried saying "something is wrong" to my personal life too.
> Turns out Debug Mode only works on apps (for now). 😅

**Video Demo Structure:**
1. Regular app working
2. App error occurs
3. Prompt: "Something is wrong"
4. Fixed
5. Update works

**Patterns Extracted:**
- Problem → Solution → Result narrative arc
- "Less guessing. More shipping" as tagline format
- Channel adaptation: LinkedIn professional, Discord casual + humor + emoji
- Video demo: Show problem → minimal prompt → instant fix
- "no explanation needed" removes friction
- Self-deprecating humor works on Discord ("Tried saying X to my personal life")
