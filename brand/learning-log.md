### 2026-01-31 - X - Real Posts Analysis (Base44 account + reposts)

**Source:** Base44 X account, Maor, Tomer, reposted builders

**Maor's style:**
> 2. This week's in-person roundtables
>
> We invited 20 users to our offices for a full day of feedback sessions.
>
> Just like that first group chat, it's been the best way to learn what's working and what we can improve.
>
> Thanks to everyone who showed up this week 🙏🏼

**Tomer (employee) - reposted:**
> I work at @base44, so I see many prompts every day.
> Most of them are okay. Some are good. But about 1% are genius.
>
> I spent the last week analyzing that top 1%.
> The results were honestly shocking. 🤯

**Base44 official - event announcement:**
> 🎉 Special announcement: We're hosting a Live AMA with our founder @MS_BASE44
>
> 2025 was an incredible founding year, and it's all thanks to our community.
>
> So we're wrapping up the year together - ask us anything about 2025 and what's coming in 2026

**Builder repost (Tristan):**
> Swapping between desktop and mobile views in my app created by @base44 is incredibly satisfying, for some reason.

**Patterns Extracted:**
- X DOES use emoji (🎉🚀🙏🏼🤯) - more than I assumed
- Community gratitude is core: "thanks to our community", "Thanks to everyone"
- Numbered thread format for longer content
- "The results were honestly shocking" - intrigue hooks work
- Repost authentic builder content (social proof)
- Cross-platform event promotion
- Personal touch: "We invited 20 users to our offices"
- Specific numbers: "about 1% are genius", "20 users"

### 2026-01-31 - Multi-channel - Debug Mode Launch (Tiffany)

**Source:** Tier 1 feature launch marketing plan

**Content Structure (LinkedIn/X):**
> When something in your app isn't working, the hardest part is often figuring out why (and how to fix it) - especially when there's no clear error.
>
> Now, you can just tell Base44: "something is wrong" or "I have an issue".
>
> We'll gather the context, pinpoint what happened, and help you get to the fix - no explanation needed.
> So you spend less time guessing and more time shipping.

**Content Structure (Discord - more casual):**
> Getting unstuck just got WAY easier 💪
>
> When something in your app isn't working, the hardest part is figuring out why ESPECIALLY when there's no clear error.
>
> Now you can just say "something is wrong." We'll gather the context, pinpoint what happened, and help you get to the fix, no long explanation needed.
>
> Less guessing. More shipping. 💪
>
> Tried saying "something is wrong" to my personal life too.
> Turns out Debug Mode only works on apps (for now). 😅

**Video Demo Structure:**
1. Regular app working
2. App error occurs
3. Prompt: "Something is wrong"
4. Fixed
5. Update works

**Patterns Extracted:**
- Problem → Solution → Result narrative arc
- "Less guessing. More shipping" as tagline format
- Channel adaptation: LinkedIn professional, Discord casual + humor + emoji
- Video demo: Show problem → minimal prompt → instant fix
- "no explanation needed" removes friction
- Self-deprecating humor works on Discord ("Tried saying X to my personal life")
