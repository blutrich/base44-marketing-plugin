## What We Already Know (From Research)

**From Laura's Social Strategy deck:**
- Brand personality: "Cool big brother — here to support, teach and tease"
- Talks to people at eye-level
- Wants to be trusted, feel like a friend
- Mission: Earn trust, establish Base44 as home for every builder

**From Shay's previous conversation:**
- Tiffany uses ChatGPT/LLM for copy but "it's not happening well enough"
- Foundation work (Brand Guidelines, examples for LLM) never got done
- Previous person (Ilai) started but didn't finish
- Shay currently approves content manually — wants to remove himself from loop once quality is consistent

**Content pillars already defined (Laura):**
1. Educational
2. Product Features & Updates
3. Use Cases & Success Stories
4. Data/ROI Proof Points
5. Community
6. Thought Leadership (Maor)

**Audience segments:**
- Prototypers (vibe coders, students) → X, Instagram, Reddit
- Pro Builders (freelancers, startups) → LinkedIn, X, Discord
- Enterprise (large companies) → LinkedIn, thought leadership

**Use these as starting points to validate or refine with Shay.**
