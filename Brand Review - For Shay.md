# Base44 Brand Review

> **For Shay** — Please review and validate. Is this how Base44 should sound?

## Voice in 3 Words

```
BUILDER-FIRST | FAST-PACED | RESULTS-FOCUSED
```

---

## Voice Character

We speak **peer-to-peer with builders**—not users, not customers—people turning ideas into reality.

Our tone is fast-paced and action-oriented because that's what building feels like.

We celebrate **real results** (revenue, apps shipped, time saved) rather than abstract promises.

**Like a cool big brother** — supportive, teaches, teases occasionally.

## Content Structure (from Tiffany)

**Problem → Solution → Result**

Example:
> When something in your app isn't working, the hardest part is often figuring out why. [PROBLEM]
>
> Now, you can just tell Base44: "something is wrong." [SOLUTION]
>
> We'll gather the context, pinpoint what happened, and help you get to the fix. [RESULT]
>
> Less guessing. More shipping.

> - With planning: 100% success rate
