# PART 2: VOICE & TONE

## Voice in 3 Words

```
BUILDER-FIRST | FAST-PACED | RESULTS-FOCUSED
```

---

## Voice Character

We speak **peer-to-peer with builders**—not users, not customers—people turning ideas into reality.

Our tone is fast-paced and action-oriented because that's what building feels like.

We celebrate **real results** (revenue, apps shipped, time saved) rather than abstract promises.

**Like a cool big brother** — supportive, teaches, teases occasionally.

## Vocabulary Rules

### Always Use → Never Use

| ✅ USE | ❌ AVOID |
|--------|----------|
| "Builders" | "Users" / "Customers" |
| "Ship" / "Go live" | "Deploy" / "Launch" |
| "Vibe coding" | "No-code" alone |
| "Just shipped" / "Dropped" | "We're excited to announce" |
| "Wild" / "Finally" | Corporate hedging |
| Action verbs, present tense | Passive voice |
| Short paragraphs | Walls of text |
| Specific numbers | Vague claims |

---

## Signature Phrases

- "Just shipped:" / "Just dropped:"
- "What's wild is—"
- "Here's the thing—"
- "Let's make your dream a reality. Right now."
- "[Builder] built [app] in [time]. Here's what happened."

## Channel Tone Adaptation

| X | Community-focused, celebratory | Yes 🎉🚀🙏🏼🤯 |

| Email | Personal, helpful | No |

### X-Specific Patterns (from real posts)

- **Intrigue hooks:** "The results were honestly shocking. 🤯"
- **Numbered threads:** For longer content (1. 2. 3.)
- **Repost builders:** Amplify authentic user content
- **Event promotion:** Cross-platform CTAs (Discord + YouTube + LinkedIn)
- **Specific numbers:** "20 users", "about 1% are genius"

## Content Structure (from Tiffany)

**Problem → Solution → Result**

Example:
> When something in your app isn't working, the hardest part is often figuring out why. [PROBLEM]
>
> Now, you can just tell Base44: "something is wrong." [SOLUTION]
>
> We'll gather the context, pinpoint what happened, and help you get to the fix. [RESULT]
>
> Less guessing. More shipping.

## Sample Content

### LinkedIn Post (Plan Mode)

> Just shipped: Plan Mode.
>
> Here's the thing—AI that codes without thinking first? That's how you get spaghetti.
>
> Plan Mode changes the game:
>
> Before writing a single line, Claude maps out your entire implementation. Architecture decisions. File structure. Edge cases. All visible. All editable.
>
> You approve the plan. Then it builds.
>
> What's wild is the difference:
> - Without planning: 53% success rate
> - With planning: 100% success rate
>
> → base44.com

### X Post (Debug Mode)

> Just shipped: Debug Mode.
>
> Something broken? No clear error? Just say "something is wrong."
>
> Base44 pulls the context. Pinpoints the issue. Gets you to the fix.
>
> Less guessing. More shipping.

### Discord (Debug Mode)

> Getting unstuck just got WAY easier 💪
>
> When something in your app isn't working, the hardest part is figuring out why ESPECIALLY when there's no clear error.
>
> Now you can just say "something is wrong." We'll gather the context, pinpoint what happened, and help you get to the fix.
>
> Less guessing. More shipping. 💪
>
> Tried saying "something is wrong" to my personal life too.
> Turns out Debug Mode only works on apps (for now). 😅
