# Marketing Patterns

## Voice Patterns
- "Builders" not "users"
- "Ship" not "deploy"
- Action verbs, present tense
- Specific numbers always

## Platform Patterns
- LinkedIn: 1-3 emoji, Hook → Details → CTA
- X: Threads for long content, intrigue hooks
- Discord: Casual, humor OK, more emoji

## Engagement Patterns
- Action CTAs only ("Try it now", "Start building")
- Builder spotlights with specific numbers
- Contest mechanics work
- NO question CTAs

## Anti-Patterns
- Arrows (→) in lists - AI tell
- Too many bullets
- Same structure every post
- Repeated phrases
