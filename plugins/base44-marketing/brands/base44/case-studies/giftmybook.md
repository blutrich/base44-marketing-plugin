## The Problem

Yoav and two friends spent months working with traditional developers on a gifting idea. Long timelines, slow progress, results that didn't justify the effort.

> "Just before Gift My Book, we worked with developers and it took a few months...and then we basically built it in a week."

---

## The Solution

They rebuilt from scratch with Base44. One week later: fully working, end-to-end product.

**What they built:**
- Simple user flow (answer questions → generate book → print & ship)
- AI-generated content and visuals
- Print-on-demand integration
- Payment processing

---

## Validation ($100 Test)

Instead of heavy investment, they ran a quick test:

1. Generated ad copy with ChatGPT
2. Spent $100 on Meta ads
3. Woke up to first purchase

> "We generated an ad on ChatGPT, put $100 ad spend on Meta, then we woke up to a purchase. That blew my friend's mind when it happened."

---

## Growth

**Conversion rates:** 6-8% (visitor → purchase)
**Peak season:** Holiday gifting (December)
**First profitable month:** December 2025

> "We're pretty close to annualized revenue of one million dollars. December is our first real profitable month. It took like three months."

---

## Why They Stayed on Base44

Original plan: Use Base44 for validation, then rebuild on "real" stack.

What happened: They never left.

- AI models kept improving (better covers, text accuracy)
- Platform scaled with their growth
- No need to rewrite working product
- Momentum > migration

## Key Takeaways

1. **Speed wins:** 1 week vs months with developers
2. **Validate cheap:** $100 proved product-market fit
3. **Don't over-engineer:** The "MVP" became the product
4. **AI improves:** Platform gets better without your effort

---

## Quotable

> "We launched it within a week. It took about a week to come up with a product that works end-to-end."

> "We reached numbers like six, seven, eight percent conversion, turning a visitor into a purchase."
