## Language Patterns to Remove

**Synonym cycling:** If the same subject gets called "the platform," then "the tool," then "the solution," then "the product" in consecutive sentences, pick one and stick with it.

**False ranges:** Remove "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a real spectrum. "From hobbyist experiments to enterprise rollouts" is filler.

**Vague attribution:** Replace "experts say," "industry observers note" with named sources or cut the claim.

**Hedging stacks:** One qualifier per claim. "It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect" becomes "The policy may affect outcomes."
