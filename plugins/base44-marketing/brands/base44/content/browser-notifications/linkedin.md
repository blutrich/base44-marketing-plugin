# LinkedIn Post — Browser Notifications

Your Base44 prompts finish while you're in another tab. Now you'll actually know about it.

Browser notifications are live in your account settings. Pick what works for you — get notified on the first prompt only, on every prompt completion, or turn them off entirely.

One thing to check before you set it up: make sure your browser and OS both allow notifications from Base44. If Do Not Disturb is on, you won't see them no matter what.

To get started: profile icon, Settings, Account settings, scroll to Chat Settings, and choose your preference from the Browser Notifications drop-down.

Small feature, big difference when you're multitasking across tabs.

Happy building! 🧪
