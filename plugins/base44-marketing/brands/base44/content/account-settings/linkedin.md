# LinkedIn Post — Account Settings

Your Base44 account settings are more powerful than you think.

Profile details, API key management, chat shortcuts, default app configs, browser notifications — all in one place.

Here's what most builders don't realize they can control:

Set new apps to start with backend functions, agents, and test data already enabled. Every app, ready to go from the moment you create it.

Regenerate your API key in seconds when you need to connect external tools. Just remember to update your integrations after.

Pick how you send chat messages — Enter or Shift+Enter — and set up browser notifications so you know the moment your prompts finish running. Switch tabs, keep shipping.

All of it lives under your profile icon. Settings. Account settings.

Happy building! 🧪
