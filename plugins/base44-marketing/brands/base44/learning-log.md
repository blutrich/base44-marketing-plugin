## Patterns Quick Reference

### Words/Phrases to AVOID
| Phrase | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Arrows (→) in lists | Outdated, looks AI-generated |
| Too many bullet points | Not every post needs a list structure |
| Overly choppy sentences | "This. Is. Not. Natural." - too robotic |
| Repeated phrases every post | "no big teams" / "for real" - vary it |
| Perfect parallel structure | Too predictable, feels AI-coded |
| Question CTAs | "What would you build?" - don't end with questions |
| "vibe-coder" in posts | Category name only, address as "builders" |
| Default hashtags | No #vibecoding #buildinpublic by default |
| Long email intros | No "You know that moment..." - start direct |
| Elaborate frameworks | Keep emails SHORT (150-200 words) |
| Generic hooks ("Just dropped") | Hooks must be creative AND relevant to the specific feature |
| Choppy "X. Y. Z." sentence structure | Sounds too polished/AI |
| "Happy shipping" sign-offs | Doesn't resonate with target audience |
| "See for yourself" CTAs | Too salesy/corporate |
| Relatable scenarios that aren't actually relatable | Ground scenarios in real builder experiences |

### Words/Phrases that WORK
| Phrase | Why |
|--------|-----|
| "Less guessing. More shipping." | Punchy tagline, action verbs |
| "no explanation needed" | Removes friction, empowers builder |
| "spend less time X, more time Y" | Contrast format shows value |
| "Another feature just dropped:" | Clean feature announcement format |
| "Moving your site to Base44 just got suspiciously easy" | Creative, fun, feature-specific |
| Feature-specific hooks | Hook should only make sense for THIS feature |
| "We're not saying you should X. We're just saying you can." | Playful, teasing closer |
| Builder is the creator, not Base44 | "You ship it" not "we build it" |
| Specific numbers ($350k, $50k ARR, $1M ARR) | Credibility |

### Tone Patterns
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Problem → Solution → Result | "When X happens... Now you can... So you..." |
| Channel-specific emoji | Discord = lots, X = some, LinkedIn = minimal |
| Community gratitude | "it's all thanks to our community" |
| Intrigue hooks | "The results were honestly shocking." |
