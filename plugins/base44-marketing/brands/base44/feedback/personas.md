## Persona 1: The Non-Technical MVP Builder
**Size:** Largest segment (~40% of interviewees)

**Job:** "When I have a business idea but no coding skills, I want to build a professional app through conversation, so I can validate my idea and ship commercially."

**Key Needs:**
- Prompt refinement help ("I can't find the right words")
- Visual design exploration (don't know what they want until they see it)
- Safe iteration (changes shouldn't break existing work)
- Confidence to go live (validation before publishing)
- Affordable pricing ($20/mo feels expensive for students/hobbyists)

**Emotional Driver:** "I'm not technical" was just a story they told themselves. Base44 broke that barrier.

**Content That Works:** Empowerment stories, "built my first app" narratives, prompt tips, beginner guides.

## Persona 2: The Agency Builder
**Size:** Small but highest revenue potential

**Job:** "When I'm building apps for multiple clients, I want a proper role hierarchy and white-label branding, so I can run a scalable agency on Base44."

**Key Needs:**
- Super Admin / Agency Admin role
- Client self-management dashboard
- App transfer between accounts
- Certification program for credibility
- Native payment processing (no redirect to external sites)
- Deep-dive training on security (RLS, SOC 2)

**Emotional Driver:** Base44 is their competitive advantage. They pre-build industry-specific apps as lead magnets.

**Content That Works:** Agency success stories, "build a business on Base44," partner program, case studies with revenue numbers.

## Persona 3: The Enterprise Power Builder
**Size:** Small but highest investment per user

**Job:** "When I'm a developer-entrepreneur with a real business, I want to build enterprise software 10x faster, so I can ship across my organization without a dev team."

**Key Needs:**
- AI precision (don't over-deliver beyond the specific request)
- Change visibility (show what changed)
- File locking and Discussion Mode
- PII encryption, audit trails, test/prod separation
- Transparent credit consumption

**Emotional Driver:** These builders NEED the platform to succeed — their businesses depend on it.

**Content That Works:** Enterprise credibility, developer social proof, "even 35-year veterans choose Base44," ROI calculators.

---

## Persona 4: The SaaS Builder
**Size:** Medium, high ambition

**Job:** "When I'm building a multi-tenant SaaS product, I want reliable scaling and proper data isolation, so I can onboard paying customers with confidence."

**Key Needs:**
- Multi-tenancy architecture
- Database scalability (20K+ rows without crashes)
- SEO for customer-facing pages
- Mobile app deployment (App Store / Play Store)
- Flexible credit purchasing

**Emotional Driver:** Scalability anxiety — "can this platform really handle a production app with paying customers?"

**Content That Works:** Scalability proof points, multi-tenant guides, SEO tutorials, success stories at scale.

---

## Persona 5: The Professional CRM Builder
**Size:** Growing — tech professionals replacing custom software

**Job:** "When I'm a professional in a specific industry, I want to build custom workflow tools, so I can outperform competitors with efficient operations."

**Key Needs:**
- Multi-app account management
- Real-time data feeds (weather, news, industry data)
- Platform-specific terminology guide
- Direct database access / BI integration

**Emotional Driver:** These builders replace tools that cost 10x more and don't fit their exact workflow.

**Content That Works:** Before/after productivity metrics, industry-specific use cases, "replace your enterprise software" positioning.

---

## Persona 6: The Educator / Hackathon Leader
**Size:** Small but viral — each graduating class = new paid users

**Job:** "When I'm preparing students for the real world, I want a tool that lets both technical and non-technical students rapidly prototype, so I can accelerate their learning and career readiness."

**Key Needs:**
- Institutional/academic pricing
- Educational content ("chunking it down")
- Stop AI self-fix credit loops
- Integration with educational tools

**Emotional Driver:** These educators test tools personally before recommending. Students go home and build things after first session.

**Content That Works:** Academic partnership stories, hackathon results, "students launch real products" narratives, institutional pricing pages.

---

## Persona 7: The Health/Impact Builder
**Size:** Small but high-value vertical

**Job:** "When I'm building a health or training app, I want medical data integrations and large media support, so I can create tools that actually serve patients/trainees."

**Key Needs:**
- Medical API integrations (Epic, Labcore, Apple Health)
- Large file upload support (images, videos for training)
- Isolated UI editing (change one section without breaking others)
- Mobile app / iOS support
- Better security defaults for personal health data

**Emotional Driver:** Building apps that save lives or improve care. Technical limitations feel like they're blocking impact.

**Content That Works:** Impact stories, "built for healthcare" positioning (when ready), compliance messaging.

---

## Persona 8: The Technical Product Builder
**Size:** Medium

**Job:** "When I'm a technical builder creating a commercial product, I want database-level access and production-grade reliability, so I can sell my app with confidence."

**Key Needs:**
- Database-level access (SQL, Power BI, Google Sheets integration)
- Reliable multi-language support
- Marketplace / multi-seller payment routing
- Real-time human support (not just tickets)
- Scalability guarantees for production apps

**Emotional Driver:** These builders have the skills to evaluate the platform critically. They stay because the speed is unmatched — but they worry about production readiness.

**Content That Works:** Technical credibility, integration guides, "built for production" messaging, developer testimonials.
