# Audience Pain Points

> What builders struggle with before Base44. Use for problem → solution messaging.

---

## Primary Pain Points

### 1. Development Takes Forever
**The pain:** Months of development before you can test if anyone wants your product.

**Evidence:**
> "Just before Gift My Book, we worked with developers and it took a few months..."

**Base44 solution:** Build end-to-end in a week.

---

### 2. Technical Setup is a Barrier
**The pain:** Before building features, you need database, auth, hosting, payments...

**Evidence:**
> "I really like that I don't have to worry about integrating with Supabase or another external database."

**Base44 solution:** Batteries included. All infrastructure handled.

---

### 3. Validation is Expensive
**The pain:** You have to build the whole thing before knowing if anyone will pay.

**Evidence:**
> "We generated an ad on ChatGPT, put $100 ad spend on Meta, then we woke up to a purchase."

**Base44 solution:** Ship fast, validate cheap.

---

### 4. Non-Technical = Dependent
**The pain:** Without coding skills, you need developers for everything.

**Evidence:**
> "Building an app with AI as a non-technical founder: what no one tells you."

**Base44 solution:** Describe in plain English, get working app.

---

### 5. Tools Don't Connect
**The pain:** AI generates UI, but you still wire everything together.

**Evidence:**
> "Base44 feels like a hybrid... optimized for non-technical founders who want an all-in-one solution."

**Base44 solution:** Complete apps, not components.

---

### 6. Scaling Requires Rebuilding
**The pain:** MVP tools don't grow with you. Eventually you rewrite everything.

**Evidence:**
> "The original plan was to use Base44 only for validation, then rebuild... But over time, that perspective changed."

**Base44 solution:** Platform scales with your business.
