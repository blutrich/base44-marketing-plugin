## Builder Quotes

### Gift My Book Team (Yoav Hornung)

> "We launched it within a week. It took about a week to come up with a product that works end-to-end."

> "Just before Gift My Book, we worked with developers and it took a few months...and then we basically built it in a week."

> "We generated an ad on ChatGPT, put $100 ad spend on Meta, then we woke up to a purchase. That blew my friend's mind when it happened."

> "We reached numbers like six, seven, eight percent conversion, turning a visitor into a purchase."

> "We're pretty close to annualized revenue of one million dollars. December is our first real profitable month. It took like three months."

### Maor Shlomo (Founder)

> "I don't think I've written a single line of HTML or JavaScript in the past 3 months."

> "I'm not going to try and scale anything before I know that users enjoy it. The best metric to seeing them enjoying it is that they're starting to share it."

> "I started with three users, really close friends. I got them to sit down with me every other day around the table."

## Product Hunt Reviews

### EdTech Innovation Center User

> "I've been using Base44 as part of our R&D efforts at the EdTech Innovation Center, and I've been blown away by how easy and effective it is to use. So far, I've built three projects with it: a teacher-focused prompt library, a 'Guess the Word' game, and a platform for creating personalized learning tracks."

> "Seamless Integration: The mix of database, AI, and a clean, intuitive UI just works. It lets you dive straight into creating value without getting bogged down in technical details."

> "Blazing Fast Prototyping: The speed is a game-changer. I could test ideas, gather feedback, and iterate so much faster than I expected."

> "Effortless Process Management: Everything is clear and easy to navigate, which makes working on the platform a genuinely enjoyable experience."

### General Reviews

> "If you're looking for a tool to bring your ideas to life quickly and smoothly, you should absolutely give it a try!"

> "Base44 is great for prototyping ideas you can showcase to potential new collaborators or investors."

> "My overall impression is really good of Base44. I really like that it has the integrated database and user authentication. I don't have to worry about integrating with Supabase or another external database."

> "Base44 feels like a hybrid of Lovable, Bolt, and Squarespace, optimized for non-technical founders or solo builders who want an all-in-one solution."

> "By using Base44, I was able to build an app prototype relatively quickly that I would not have been able to do otherwise. That's pretty huge."

> "Base44 wins in terms of clarity, simplicity, and execution."
