# Base44 Content Rules

> **MANDATORY.** Read this FIRST before creating ANY content.
> These rules are non-negotiable. Violating them = rejection.

---

## NEVER DO (Instant Rejection)

1. **No arrows (→)** - Looks AI-generated, outdated (Lora, 2026-02-01)
2. **No "users" or "customers"** - Say "builders" (Brand core)
3. **No "deploy" or "launch"** - Say "ship" or "go live" (Brand core)
4. **No "We're excited to announce"** - Corporate, not builder (Brand core)
5. **No walls of text** - Short paragraphs only (Brand core)
6. **No question CTAs** - Don't end posts with "What would you build?" or similar (2026-02-02)
7. **No "vibe-coder" in posts** - "Vibe coding" is category name only, address audience as "builders" (2026-02-02)

## NEVER DO (Quality Issues)

8. **No repeated phrases every post** - Vary "for real", "no big teams" (Lora, 2026-02-01)
9. **No overly choppy sentences** - "This. Is. Not. Natural." (Lora, 2026-02-01)
10. **No perfect parallel structure** - Too predictable, AI-tell (Lora, 2026-02-01)
11. **No emoji as bullets** - Spammy (Brand core)
12. **No external links in LinkedIn/X main post** - Kills reach (Platform rules)
13. **No default hashtags** - Only use hashtags if tagging a specific activity (2026-02-02)
14. **No generic hooks** - "Just dropped" is interchangeable. Hooks must be creative, fun, and specific to the feature being announced (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
15. **No "X. Y. Z." choppy structure** - "Paste any URL. Base44 will..." sounds too polished/AI. Write flowing sentences (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
16. **No "Happy shipping" / "Enjoy building" sign-offs** - Doesn't resonate. Find closers that are engaging and feature-relevant (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
17. **No "see for yourself" CTAs** - Sounds too salesy/corporate. Base44 doesn't talk like an infomercial (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
18. **No fake-relatable scenarios** - If the "you know when..." scenario isn't a genuinely common experience for builders, don't use it. Ground openers in real experiences (Ofer 2026-02-08)
19. **No TV-ad tagline cadence** - "One workspace. Unlimited builders. No friction." is TV commercial script, not builder talk. Avoid stacked short declarative fragments that read like ad copy (Shay, 2026-02-09)
20. **No bulleted idea lists as final output** - Bulleted lists of ideas is an "AI thing." Deliver holistic plans with narrative structure, not grocery lists (Shay, 2026-02-09)
21. **No advertising melody** - If the rhythm sounds like it belongs on a billboard or in a 30-second spot, rewrite it. Content should sound like how Maor actually talks, not copywriting (Shay, 2026-02-09)
22. **No feature names in posts** - Never lead with or name the internal feature. Lead with the value it gives builders and how it improves their life. "Builder Skills" → "You can now customize how your AI builder works." The feature name can appear once, buried, never as the hook (Ofer, 2026-02-22)

## ALWAYS DO

1. **Sound like builder to builder** - Peer conversation, not corporate
2. **Use specific numbers** - "$1M ARR", "400K+ builders", "3 weeks"
3. **Show results, not promises** - What happened, not what might
4. **Natural sentence flow** - Mix short and medium sentences
5. **Vary structure** - Not every post needs lists
6. **Hooks must match the feature** - The hook should only make sense for THIS specific feature, not be interchangeable (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
7. **End posts with engagement, not filler** - Feature-relevant closers, or occasionally "how will you use this?" when it fits naturally (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
8. **Sound like Maor** - Read Maor's actual LinkedIn posts in learning-log.md. Match his casual, specific, story-driven cadence. Not copywriting. Not advertising. Conversation. (Shay, 2026-02-09)
9. **Holistic plans over idea dumps** - When brainstorming, deliver integrated marketing plans: channels, timeline, assets needed, how it all connects. Not a list of disconnected tactics. (Shay, 2026-02-09)
10. **Use inline SVG for the logo** - Never render the Base44 logo as plain text. Always use inline SVG from `design-system.md`. Never use base64 PNG (it corrupts). (2026-02-18)
