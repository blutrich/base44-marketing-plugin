# Base44 Content Rules

> **MANDATORY.** Read this FIRST before creating ANY content.
> These rules are non-negotiable. Violating them = rejection.

---

## NEVER DO (Instant Rejection)

1. **No arrows (→)** - Looks AI-generated, outdated (Lora, 2026-02-01)
2. **No "users" or "customers"** - Say "builders" (Brand core)
3. **No "deploy" or "launch"** - Say "ship" or "go live" (Brand core)
4. **No "We're excited to announce"** - Corporate, not builder (Brand core)
5. **No walls of text** - Short paragraphs only (Brand core)
6. **No question CTAs** - Don't end posts with "What would you build?" or similar (2026-02-02)
7. **No "vibe-coder" in posts** - "Vibe coding" is category name only, address audience as "builders" (2026-02-02)

## NEVER DO (Quality Issues)

8. **No repeated phrases every post** - Vary "for real", "no big teams" (Lora, 2026-02-01)
9. **No overly choppy sentences** - "This. Is. Not. Natural." (Lora, 2026-02-01)
10. **No perfect parallel structure** - Too predictable, AI-tell (Lora, 2026-02-01)
11. **No emoji as bullets** - Spammy (Brand core)
12. **No external links in LinkedIn/X main post** - Kills reach (Platform rules)
13. **No default hashtags** - Only use hashtags if tagging a specific activity (2026-02-02)
14. **No generic hooks** - "Just dropped" is interchangeable. Hooks must be creative, fun, and specific to the feature being announced (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
15. **No "X. Y. Z." choppy structure** - "Paste any URL. Base44 will..." sounds too polished/AI. Write flowing sentences (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
16. **No "Happy shipping" / "Enjoy building" sign-offs** - Doesn't resonate. Find closers that are engaging and feature-relevant (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
17. **No "see for yourself" CTAs** - Sounds too salesy/corporate. Base44 doesn't talk like an infomercial (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
18. **No fake-relatable scenarios** - If the "you know when..." scenario isn't a genuinely common experience for builders, don't use it. Ground openers in real experiences (Ofer 2026-02-08)
19. **No TV-ad tagline cadence** - "One workspace. Unlimited builders. No friction." is TV commercial script, not builder talk. Avoid stacked short declarative fragments that read like ad copy (Shay, 2026-02-09)
20. **No bulleted idea lists as final output** - Bulleted lists of ideas is an "AI thing." Deliver holistic plans with narrative structure, not grocery lists (Shay, 2026-02-09)
21. **No advertising melody** - If the rhythm sounds like it belongs on a billboard or in a 30-second spot, rewrite it. Content should sound like how Maor actually talks, not copywriting (Shay, 2026-02-09)
22. **No feature names in posts** - Never lead with or name the internal feature. Lead with the value it gives builders and how it improves their life. "Builder Skills" → "You can now customize how your AI builder works." The feature name can appear once, buried, never as the hook (Ofer, 2026-02-22)

## NEVER DO (Anti-AI — Orbach Patterns)

23. **No AI filler verbs** - Never use: leverage, utilize, delve, craft (figurative), garner, elevate, amplify, spearhead, streamline, curate, harness, cultivate, navigate (figurative), facilitate, embark, empower, bolster, catalyze, augment, maximize, reimagine, resonate, revolutionize, showcase, underscore, unlock (figurative), unpack (figurative), demystify, foster, enhance. Use the plain word: leverage = use, facilitate = help, craft = write/make, empower = let/enable, streamline = simplify, curate = pick. Full list in `banned-words.md`. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
24. **No AI filler adjectives** - Never use: groundbreaking, cutting-edge, innovative, robust, seamless, scalable, transformative, unprecedented, dynamic, holistic, comprehensive, compelling, remarkable, pivotal, crucial, meticulous, multifaceted, profound, vibrant, vital, state-of-the-art, synergistic, tailored, thought-provoking, game-changing, noteworthy, nuanced, paramount. Say what you actually mean. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
25. **No "it's not X, it's Y" contrast framing** - All variants banned: "It's not about X. It's about Y." / "It's not A. It's not even B. It's actually C." Just say what you mean directly. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
26. **No self-narration** - Never announce what you're about to say. Delete: "Here's why this matters", "The key takeaway is", "The kicker?", "The bottom line?", "Now for the interesting part", "What does this mean?", "Why does this matter?", "Why should you care?" Say the thing. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
27. **No significance inflation** - Never announce importance instead of showing it. Delete: "marking a pivotal moment", "setting the stage for", "a testament to", "paving the way for", "raising the bar", "pushing the envelope", "bridges the gap". Explain why with a specific fact. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
28. **No rule-of-three groupings** - If you spot three adjectives, three bullets, or three parallel phrases, cut to two or expand to four+. Two is almost always enough. Trios are an AI fingerprint. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
29. **No transition word openers** - Never open a sentence with: However, Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally, Nevertheless, Notably, Indeed, Consequently, Accordingly, Fundamentally, Essentially, Inherently, Particularly. Just start the sentence. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
30. **No "-ing phrase" padding** - Never end a sentence with a trailing participial phrase that adds no info: "...highlighting the importance of...", "...underscoring the need for...". Make it a new sentence with specifics. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
31. **No copula avoidance** - Use "is" and "has" instead of fancy substitutes. "Serves as a powerful solution" = "is useful". "Boasts a comprehensive suite" = "has a dashboard". "Stands as" / "functions as" / "acts as" = "is". (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
32. **No fake naming** - Don't capitalize ordinary ideas or give them a "The" prefix. "The Growth Paradox", "The 5-Step Framework" = just describe what you mean. If it doesn't have a real established name, don't invent one. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
33. **No em dashes** - Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead. Em dashes are the single biggest AI tell in 2026. Zero tolerance. (Nina, 2026-02-28)
34. **No "let's" openers** - "Let's dive in," "Let's break this down," "Let's explore" sound like a YouTube video intro. Just start. (Editor, 2026-02-28)
35. **No synonym cycling** - If you call something "the platform" then "the tool" then "the solution" then "the product" in consecutive sentences, pick one word and stick with it. (Editor, 2026-02-28)
36. **No false ranges** - Remove "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a real spectrum. "From hobbyist experiments to enterprise rollouts" is filler. (Editor, 2026-02-28)
37. **No hedging stacks** - One qualifier per claim max. "It could potentially possibly be argued that" becomes "The policy may affect outcomes." (Editor, 2026-02-28)
38. **No boldface abuse** - Don't mechanically bold key terms in every sentence. Use bold sparingly or not at all in social posts. (Editor, 2026-02-28)

## ALWAYS DO

1. **Sound like builder to builder** - Peer conversation, not corporate
2. **Use specific numbers** - "$1M ARR", "400K+ builders", "3 weeks"
3. **Show results, not promises** - What happened, not what might
4. **Natural sentence flow** - Mix short and medium sentences
5. **Vary structure** - Not every post needs lists
6. **Hooks must match the feature** - The hook should only make sense for THIS specific feature, not be interchangeable (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
7. **End posts with engagement, not filler** - Feature-relevant closers, or occasionally "how will you use this?" when it fits naturally (Asaf 2026-02-06, Ofer 2026-02-08)
8. **Sound like Maor** - Read Maor's actual LinkedIn posts in learning-log.md. Match his casual, specific, story-driven cadence. Not copywriting. Not advertising. Conversation. (Shay, 2026-02-09)
9. **Holistic plans over idea dumps** - When brainstorming, deliver integrated marketing plans: channels, timeline, assets needed, how it all connects. Not a list of disconnected tactics. (Shay, 2026-02-09)
10. **Use inline SVG for the logo** - Never render the Base44 logo as plain text. Always use inline SVG from `design-system.md`. Never use base64 PNG (it corrupts). (2026-02-18)
11. **Use plain words** - Replace AI vocabulary with plain English: leverage/utilize/harness = use, facilitate = help, implement = start/build, optimize = improve, expedite = speed up, augment = add to, amplify = increase, elevate = raise/improve, empower = let/enable, navigate = handle, spearhead = lead, streamline = simplify, curate = pick, craft = write/make. Full list in `banned-words.md`. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
12. **Vary groupings** - When you write three of anything (adjectives, bullets, parallel phrases), change to two or four+. Two is almost always enough. (Orbach, 2026-02-26)
13. **Have opinions** - React to what you're writing about. "I don't know how to feel about this" beats a neutral list of pros and cons. Mixed feelings are human. (Editor, 2026-02-28)
14. **Leave some imperfection** - An aside, a half-formed thought, or an honest "I'm not sure" is more convincing than a clean five-paragraph essay. Perfect structure feels algorithmic. (Editor, 2026-02-28)
