# X (Twitter) Post Template

## Format Rules
- **Length:** 280 characters max
- **Thread:** Use for longer announcements (4-6 tweets)
- **Hook:** First tweet must standalone and grab attention
- **Media:** Include image/video when possible

## Single Tweet Structure

```
[HOOK + VALUE in one punch]

[LINK or CTA]
```

## Thread Structure

```
🧵 Tweet 1: [Hook - the big claim or news]

Tweet 2: [The problem it solves]

Tweet 3: [How it works - brief]

Tweet 4: [Key benefit 1]

Tweet 5: [Key benefit 2]

Tweet 6: [CTA + link]
```

## Voice Adjustments for X
- More casual than LinkedIn
- Punchy, direct
- Can be playful/teasing (cool big brother energy)
- Emojis OK but don't overdo
