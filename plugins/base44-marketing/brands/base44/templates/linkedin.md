# LinkedIn Post Template

## Format Rules
- **Length:** 1,300 characters max (ideal: 800-1,000)
- **Line breaks:** Use short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- **Hook:** First line must grab attention (it's the preview)
- **CTA:** End with clear call-to-action

## Structure

```
[HOOK - 1 compelling line that shows in preview]

[CONTEXT - 2-3 sentences on what/why]

[KEY POINTS - bullet points or short paragraphs]
• Point 1
• Point 2
• Point 3

[CTA - what should they do next]

[LINK if applicable]
```

## Voice Adjustments for LinkedIn
- Slightly more professional than X
- Still conversational, not corporate
- Can be longer-form
- Credibility matters more here

## Examples

## Hashtag Strategy
- **Only use hashtags if tagging a specific activity** (e.g., contest, event, campaign)
- No default hashtags on regular posts
- If needed: max 2-3, place at end
