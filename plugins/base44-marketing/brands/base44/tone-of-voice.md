# Base44 — Tone of Voice

> How Base44 sounds across all content: Builder-first, energetic, and community-driven.

---

## Voice Character

Base44's voice is genuinely excited about democratizing app creation. We speak directly to builders—not users, not customers—people who are turning ideas into reality. Our tone is fast-paced and action-oriented because that's what building feels like. We celebrate real results (revenue, apps shipped, time saved) rather than abstract promises.

---

## Core Attributes

### 1. Builder-Centric
We speak peer-to-peer with people who make things. No corporate distance. No talking down. Our audience builds, and so do we. We understand the rush of shipping something real.

### 2. Fast-Paced
Our language mirrors our platform: immediate, energetic, momentum-driven. We use action verbs: "ship", "drop", "go live", "build". No passive voice when active will do.

### 3. Results-Focused
We lead with outcomes, not features. Revenue numbers. Apps powered. Time saved. Real stories from real builders. The proof is in what people built, not what we promise.

## Voice Influences

Base44's voice draws from:

- **Startup energy** — The excitement of building something new
- **Developer directness** — Technical credibility without jargon overload
- **Community warmth** — Celebrating builders, not just the product
- **Founder authenticity** — Maor's unfiltered style: "90% of my code was written by Claude"

## Vocabulary Patterns

### Signature Words & Phrases
- "Builders" (never "users" or "customers")
- "Ship" / "Go live" (never "deploy" or "launch")
- "Drop" (for releases: "Just dropped a new feature")
- "Vibe coding" (our category name)
- "Let's make your dream a reality. Right now."
- "Just shipped"
- "Apps powered by Base44"
- "The community" / "Our builders"

### Intensifiers
- "Just" (for simplicity: "Just shipped", "Just dropped")
- "Wild" (for impressive results: "Wild that this took 3 hours")
- "Finally" (for long-awaited features)
- "Right now" (for immediacy)

### Connectors & Transitions
- "And here's the thing," (use sparingly, 1-2 per post max. Too many em dashes = AI tell)
- "What's wild is,"
- "Speaking of,"
- "Quick update:"
- "Just shipped:"

## Writing Guidelines

### Do
- Use contractions naturally (we're, it's, don't)
- Lead with outcomes and results
- Include specific numbers ($1M ARR, 400K+ builders, 3 weeks)
- Celebrate builder success stories
- Be direct and confident
- Show, don't just tell (demos, screenshots, videos)
- Use action verbs in present tense
- Keep paragraphs short for momentum

### Don't
- Say "users" or "customers" (say "builders")
- Say "deploy" or "launch" (say "ship" or "go live")
- Use corporate speak ("leveraging synergies")
- Hedge with qualifiers ("might", "perhaps", "we think")
- Promise without proof
- Use passive voice when active works
- Over-explain—trust our builders are smart
- Use "no-code" without context (we're "vibe coding")

---

## Sentence Patterns

### Opening Hooks
- "Just shipped: [feature]"
- "[Builder name] built [app] in [timeframe]. Here's what happened."
- "What if you could [benefit]? Now you can."
- "[Number] builders are already [doing thing]"
- "We heard you. [Feature] is live."

### Explanations
Start with what it enables, then how it works. Always end with "try it now" energy:
> "Connect your Stripe account and start accepting payments in your app. Test mode included so you can build with confidence."

### Transitions
Move fast between ideas. Use line breaks and short connectors:
> "New this week: Gmail integration. Your app can now send and receive emails, and yes, read them too. Took us 3 days to build."

## Anti-AI Patterns (CRITICAL)

Content should NOT feel AI-generated. Avoid these tells:

### DON'T Use (Outdated/AI-Coded)
- **Arrows in lists (→)** - Feels AI-generated, outdated
- **Too many bullet points** - Every post looking like a list
- **Overly choppy sentences** - "This. Is. Not. Natural."
- **Repeated phrases** - Don't use "no big teams, lean only" or "for real" in every post
- **Perfect parallel structure** - Real writing has variety
- **Emoji as bullet points** - Spammy, AI-tell

### DO Use (Human Patterns)
- **Natural sentence flow** - Mix short and medium sentences
- **Varied structure** - Not every post needs headers/lists
- **Conversation rhythm** - Write like you're talking
- **One-off phrases** - Use signature phrases sparingly, not every post
- **Imperfection** - Occasional fragment or casual aside is OK

### AI-Detection Checklist
Before posting, ask:
1. Would this pass if someone checked with AI detectors?
2. Does every paragraph start the same way? (Bad)
3. Are there too many lists/bullets? (Bad)
4. Is the structure too perfect/predictable? (Bad)
5. Would Laura write it this way? (Good test)

## Anti-Advertising Patterns (SHAY DIRECTIVE)

Content should NOT sound like advertising copy. Shay's specific feedback: "The melody of the text is wrong -- not native to platform."

### The TV-Ad Test
Read your content aloud. If it sounds like:
- A Super Bowl commercial voiceover
- A billboard headline
- A radio spot
- A tagline on a bus stop ad

**Rewrite it.** It should sound like a Slack message from Maor to the team, or a LinkedIn post from a founder who's genuinely excited.

### DON'T Write (TV-Ad Cadence)
- "One workspace. Unlimited builders. No friction." (stacked declarative fragments)
- "Build faster. Ship smarter. Scale infinitely." (triple parallel structure)
- "The platform. The community. The future." (article + noun stacking)
- Any text that could be read over a swooshing logo animation

### DO Write (Founder Voice)
- "We just shipped something that took us 3 weeks and honestly I'm still surprised it works this well"
- "400K+ builders are using Base44 now. Wild that this started as a side project."
- "Just heard from a builder who replaced their $350K Salesforce contract. With one Base44 app. Built in a weekend."

### The Maor Test
Before publishing, ask: "Would Maor post this on his LinkedIn exactly as written?"
- If yes: ship it
- If you'd need to "make it more polished": you've already failed -- Maor's voice IS the polish

---

## Voice Test

Before publishing, ask:

1. Does this sound like a builder talking to another builder?
2. Are we using action verbs ("ship", "build", "drop") not passive ones?
3. Are we showing results, not just promises?
4. Would our audience feel "I can actually do this right now"?
5. Is there a shorter, punchier way to say this?
6. Does it feel human-written, not AI-coded?
