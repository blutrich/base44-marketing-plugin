## Voice (3 Words)

```
BUILDER-FIRST | FAST-PACED | RESULTS-FOCUSED
```

## Quick Rules

```
USE                          AVOID
─────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────
"Builders"                   "Users" / "Customers" / "Vibe-coders"
"Ship" / "Go live"           "Deploy" / "Launch"
"Vibe coding" (category)     "No-code" alone
"Just shipped" / "Dropped"   "We're excited to announce"
"Wild" / "Finally"           Corporate hedging
Action verbs, present        Passive voice
Short paragraphs             Walls of text
Specific numbers             Vague claims
Action CTAs                  Question CTAs (no "What would you build?")
```

**Note:** "Vibe coding" = category/positioning term. Address audience as "builders", never "vibe-coders".

## Voice Character

We speak peer-to-peer with builders. Fast-paced, action-oriented. Celebrate real results (revenue, apps shipped, time saved) not abstract promises. Like a cool big brother — supportive, teaches, teases occasionally.

## Signature Phrases

- "Just shipped:" / "Just dropped:"
- "What's wild is—"
- "Here's the thing—"
- "Let's make your dream a reality. Right now."
- "[Builder] built [app] in [time]. Here's what happened."

## Before Publishing

1. Does this sound like a builder talking to a builder?
2. Are we using action verbs ("ship", "build")?
3. Are we showing results, not just promises?
4. Would reader feel "I can do this right now"?
5. Is there a shorter way to say this?
