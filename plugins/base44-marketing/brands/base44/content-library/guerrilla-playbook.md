# Guerrilla Marketing Playbook

> Zero budget. Maximum disruption. Ship in 24 hours.
> Organic social tactics to drive buzz. No paid ads required.

## Core Principles

1. **24-Hour Execution** — If you can't ship it today, simplify
2. **Asymmetric ROI** — Small effort, massive results
3. **AI-Proof** — Focus on authenticity, relationships, weirdness

**Before any tactic, ask:**
- Can I do this in 24 hours?
- Is the upside 10x+ the effort?
- Could AI replicate this? (If yes, it's not a moat)

## Tactic 1: Reverse Psychology Posts

Tell people NOT to do something. Triggers reactance, curiosity, pattern interrupt.

**The "Not Ready" Challenge:**
> Don't download Base44.
>
> Seriously.
>
> Building your own app requires:
> - An idea (even a bad one works)
> - 20 minutes
> - The ability to tap buttons
>
> If that sounds like too much... this isn't for you.
>
> Still here? Fine. Link in bio.

**The Warning Label:**
> WARNING: Side effects of using Base44 may include:
> - Accidentally building an app before lunch
> - Explaining to friends that yes, you made that yourself
> - The uncomfortable realization that "I'm not technical" was just a story you told yourself
>
> Download at your own risk.

**The Reverse Testimonial:**
> 1-star review of Base44:
>
> "I downloaded this thinking it would take weeks to build my app. It took 2 hours. Now I have nothing to complain about at dinner parties."
>
> If you enjoy having excuses, don't download this.

**The Follow-Up (run 1 week later):**
> Last week I told you not to download Base44.
>
> 847 of you ignored me.
>
> Here's what you built:
> [Screenshot collage of user apps]
>
> I give up. Do what you want.

**Rule:** 1 in 5 posts max. Don't overuse.

## Tactic 2: Competitor Comment Infiltration

Find people complaining about competitors. Show up with genuine help.

**Where to hunt:**

X/Twitter searches:
- "no-code" + "frustrated"
- "app builder" + "expensive"
- "[competitor]" + "alternative"
- "wish I could build an app"

Reddit:
- r/nocode (sort by new)
- r/startups ("MVP" posts)
- r/SideProject ("need developer" posts)

**Response template:**
> Had the same frustration. Ended up trying Base44 — built my first app in about an hour. Not affiliated, just genuinely worked for my use case. Happy to share what I built if helpful.

**Rule:** Help first. Mention Base44 second. Never copy-paste.

---

## Tactic 3: Screenshot Ambush

Screenshot-style content that looks organic.

**"DM from a friend":**
> [iMessage screenshot]
>
> Friend: "Wait you built that yourself?"
> You: "Yeah, took like 2 hours"
> Friend: "I thought you couldn't code"
> You: "I can't"
> Friend: "???"
> You: "Base44"
>
> Caption: This conversation happens weekly now.

**"Before/After":**
> Left: Notes app with "App idea - need to find developer"
> Right: App Store listing of finished app
>
> Caption: 3 weeks apart. No developer found. Used Base44 instead.

## Tactic 4: The Hijack Calendar

Ride existing news waves with a Base44 angle.

| Event | Base44 Angle |
|-------|-------------|
| Apple WWDC | "While everyone waits for new dev tools, you can ship today" |
| Product Hunt launches | Helpful comments on competitor products |
| "Learn to code" discourse | "Or... don't. Build anyway." |
| Tech layoffs | "Laid off? Build your own thing this week." |
| New Year / Mondays | "Your app idea has been in your notes for 2 years" |

**Template:**
> Everyone's talking about [EVENT].
>
> Meanwhile, [NUMBER] people quietly shipped apps this week using Base44.
>
> No announcements. No hype. Just building.

---

## Tactic 5: Engagement Bait

Posts designed to drive comments (boosting algorithmic reach).

**The Poll:**
> How long do you think it takes to build a basic app?
>
> 6+ months / 1-3 months / A few weeks / Under a week
>
> (Wrong answers only apparently)

**The Hot Take:**
> 90% of apps don't need a developer.
>
> Agree or disagree?

**The Fill-in-the-blank:**
> The app I've been "meaning to build" for years is _______.
>
> (Drop yours below — I'm curious what's stuck in everyone's notes app)

## Tactic 6: Real-Time Story Takeover

Document building something in Base44 via Stories or threads.

> Story 1: "Going to try building an app idea I've had for months. Starting now."
> Story 2: "Okay, picked a template. This is surprisingly not terrible."
> Story 3: "Wait I just added a feature. It worked??"
> Story 4: [Screen recording of the app working]
> Story 5: "It's been 47 minutes. I have an app. What is happening."
> Story 6: "Submitting to App Store now. If you want to try: [link]"

**Why:** Real-time = authentic. People watch to see if you'll fail. You don't. They download.

---

## Tactic 7: Coordinated Title Takeover

Have entire team change LinkedIn titles simultaneously.

**Execution:**
1. Pick launch day
2. Everyone changes titles within 2-hour window
3. Each person posts about Base44 same day

**Title Ideas:**
- "App Developer (no code required)"
- "Former 'I Need a Technical Co-Founder' Believer"
- "Chief 'Just Ship It' Officer"

**Why:** LinkedIn notifies everyone's network about job changes. 10 people = 10 notification blasts.
