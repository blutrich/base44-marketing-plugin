> Proven opening lines and attention-grabbers. Use as templates, adapt to context.

## Result-First Hooks

Lead with the outcome, then explain.

- "$1M ARR in 3 months. One builder. One week to build."
- "$80M in 6 months. Zero funding. One founder."
- "400K builders. 10M apps. No code required."
- "6-8% conversion. First try. $100 ad spend."
- "$189K profit in one month. Solo."

---

## Builder Spotlight Hooks

Feature real people and their wins.

- "[Name] built [app] in [time]. Here's what happened."
- "A restaurant manager just built a SaaS business. Without writing code."
- "Doctors are using Base44 to organize patient data. Teachers for lesson plans. NGOs for disaster relief."
- "This EdTech team built 3 prototypes in days. Not months."

---

## Behind-the-Scenes Hooks

Transparency builds trust.

- "Here's everything we shipped in the past 7 days:"
- "The team is shipping faster than I can post about it."
- "We just upgraded to [feature]. You won't notice anything different. Except your bills getting smaller."
- "Just shipped: [Feature Name]"
- "Another feature just dropped:"

---

## Possibility Hooks

Open with "what if" to create intrigue.

- "What if you could build an app by just describing it?"
- "What if your next SaaS didn't need developers?"
- "What would you build if coding wasn't the bottleneck?"

---

## Social Proof Hooks

Numbers and momentum.

- "12 apps launched this week by Base44 builders."
- "400K builders and counting."
- "This builder went from idea to revenue in 3 days."

---

## Direct Value Hooks

Punchy benefit statements.

- "Ship faster. Iterate faster. Break less."
- "Less guessing. More shipping."
- "Your idea. Working app. Minutes."
- "No backend setup. No database config. Just build."

## BANNED Patterns (Never Use)

- Arrows (→, ➡️, ▸) - AI-tell
- "We're excited to announce" - Corporate
- FOMO language ("Don't miss out!")
- Question CTAs at end ("What would you build?")
- Emoji as bullets
- Contrarian bait ("Everyone's wrong about...")

---

## Hook Formula

**Structure:** [Specific Result] + [Surprising Context] + [Implied "how"]

**Example:**
- Result: "$1M ARR"
- Context: "3 months, 1 week to build"
- Implied how: (reader wants to know)
