# Base44 Objection Handling

> Common objections and how to address them. For sales, support, and content.

---

## "Is it just for prototypes?"

**Objection:** AI builders are only good for MVPs, not real products.

**Response:**
Gift My Book hit $1M ARR and stayed on Base44. They planned to migrate to a "real" stack—never needed to. The platform scales with your business.

**Proof points:**
- $3.5M ARR at acquisition
- 400K users on platform
- 70-75% profit margins
- Enterprise partnerships (eToro, Similarweb)

---

## "Can it handle complex apps?"

**Objection:** My use case is too complex for AI.

**Response:**
Base44 handles authentication, databases, payments, integrations, and custom logic. Builders have created healthcare trackers, financial tools, and enterprise dashboards. If you can describe it, you can build it.

**Proof points:**
- Doctor patient management systems
- EdTech learning platforms
- Enterprise internal tools
- Multi-step e-commerce flows

---

## "What about security?"

**Objection:** I don't trust AI-generated code for sensitive data.

**Response:**
Base44 is SOC 2 compliant and acquired by Wix (public company with enterprise security standards). Your data is encrypted, isolated, and protected by the same infrastructure used by millions of Wix sites.

**Proof points:**
- Wix backing ($80M acquisition)
- Enterprise customers
- Healthcare use cases (HIPAA considerations)

---

## "I'll lose control of my code"

**Objection:** What if I need to customize or migrate?

**Response:**
Base44 offers GitHub sync and code export. Every change syncs to your repo. You can edit in VS Code and push back. You own your code—we just help you write it faster.

**Proof points:**
- Two-way GitHub sync
- Full code export
- Custom SDK for developers
- OpenAPI import for integrations

## "It's too expensive with AI credits"

**Objection:** The credit system will eat my budget.

**Response:**
Compare to developer salaries, not to free tools. Gift My Book reached profitability with 70-75% margins. The credit cost is a fraction of traditional development—and you ship in days, not months.

**Proof points:**
- $1M ARR in 3 months (profitable)
- $189K monthly profit
- Zero developer salaries
- Validation with $100 ad spend

---

## "What if the AI makes mistakes?"

**Objection:** AI code has bugs.

**Response:**
We've invested heavily in error handling and iteration. Tell Base44 "something is wrong" and it gathers context, identifies issues, and suggests fixes. Debug Mode turns problems into conversations.

**Proof points:**
- Debug Mode feature
- Claude 4 reduces bugs significantly
- Iterative improvement with plain English
- "AI teams up with you step-by-step"

## "I'm technical—why would I use this?"

**Objection:** I can code myself.

**Response:**
So can Maor—he built Base44. But he uses AI to write 90% of his frontend because it's faster. Skip the boilerplate. Focus on unique business logic. Push to production daily without getting stuck on setup.

**Proof points:**
- Founder wrote 90% frontend with AI
- No HTML/JS in 3 months
- Daily production deploys
- Focus on what matters

## "The market is too crowded"

**Objection:** Lovable, Bolt, Replit—why Base44?

**Response:**
Base44 is batteries-included. No Supabase setup, no Auth0 config, no wiring together services. One platform, complete apps. And now backed by Wix with access to millions of users.

**Proof points:**
- $80M acquisition (validated by market)
- 400K users (builders chose us)
- Wix distribution advantage
- Distinct positioning (complete apps, not components)
