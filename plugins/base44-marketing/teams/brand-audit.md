# Brand Audit Team Template

## When to Use
Review existing content for brand consistency, or audit the plugin's own outputs.

## Team Structure
| Role | Focus | Model |
|------|-------|-------|
| Lead | Coordinate and synthesize | Opus |
| Voice reviewer | Tone, word choice, banned phrases | Sonnet |
| Format reviewer | Structure, hooks, CTAs, platform specs | Sonnet |
| Psychology reviewer | Persuasion principles, bias usage | Sonnet |

## Process
1. All reviewers read the same content
2. Each applies their lens independently
3. Lead collects findings, resolves conflicts, produces final report
