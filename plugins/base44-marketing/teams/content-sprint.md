# Content Sprint Team Template

## When to Use
Batch content generation — e.g., "Create 5 LinkedIn posts and 3 tweets for this week."

## Team Structure
| Role | Count | Model | Owns Files |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| Lead | 1 | Opus | Sprint plan, assignment |
| LinkedIn writers | 1-2 | Sonnet | output/linkedin/post-N.md |
| X writers | 1 | Sonnet | output/x/tweet-N.md |
| Brand guardian | 1 | Haiku | output/reviews/ |

## Task Sizing
- 3-5 content pieces per teammate (sweet spot)
- Each piece = 1 task in the shared task list
- Guardian reviews after each piece completes (use task dependencies)
