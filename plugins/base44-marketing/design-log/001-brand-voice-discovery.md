## Background

Base44 marketing team lacks official Brand Guidelines. Content quality is inconsistent because:
- No documented voice/tone rules
- Each team member interprets brand differently
- Shay manually approves all content (bottleneck)
- LLM-generated content doesn't match brand expectations

## Problem Statement

**How do we capture Shay's brand vision in a format that:**
1. Humans can follow consistently
2. AI agents can apply automatically
3. Enables self-learning from feedback
