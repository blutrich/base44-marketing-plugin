# Landing Page Architecture Skill

> Build high-converting landing pages using the 8-Section Framework.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when creating:
- Landing pages
- Lead magnet pages
- Product launch pages
- Sales pages
- Webinar registration pages
- Service offering pages
- Pricing pages
- Squeeze pages

## Core Philosophy

**Page architecture = conversion psychology.** Every section has ONE job. Each section earns the right to show the next section. Skip a section, lose the visitor.

Two key principles:
1. **The 8-Section Framework** - WHERE elements go and WHY
2. **SLIDE Alignment** - Connect structure to persuasive copy

---

## The 8-Section Framework

### 1. HERO
**Job:** Get email OR get scroll

**Components:** Eyebrow → Headline → Subheadline → CTA → Trust Signals

```
[Eyebrow: Social proof or category]
For AI Consultants Who Want Predictable Revenue

[Headline: 10-15 words max]
Get 3 Qualified Leads Per Week Without Cold Outreach

[Subheadline: How + de-risk]
The exact system I used to book $47K in Q1. No ads. No cold DMs.

[CTA: Benefit-focused]
[Get the Free Playbook]

[Trust signals]
Trusted by 2,847 consultants | Featured in Forbes
```

### 2. SUCCESS
**Job:** Kill buyer's remorse

**Components:** Checkmark → Confirmation → Deliverable list

```
✓ You're in! Here's what happens next:

In the next 5 minutes, you'll receive:
□ The 3-Step Lead System PDF (47 pages)
□ The Outreach Template Pack (12 templates)
□ The Qualification Scorecard
```

### 3. PROBLEM-AGITATE
**Job:** Make status quo painful

**Components:** 3 problems → Agitation → Personal transition

```
Sound familiar?

❌ You're great at your work, but terrible at finding it
❌ Feast or famine pipeline - no predictability
❌ Spending nights on proposals that go nowhere

Here's the worst part: Every week without a system
costs you $4,000+ in missed opportunities.

I know because I was there...
```

### 4. VALUE STACK
**Job:** Make "no" feel stupid

**Components:** 4 tiers → Total value → Your price

```
Here's everything you get:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Complete Lead Generation System    │
│ 47-page playbook           $997    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 12 Outreach Templates      $497    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Qualification Scorecard    $297    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Private Community Access   $197    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
               Total Value: $1,988

          Your Investment: FREE
```

### 5. SOCIAL PROOF
**Job:** Let others convince

**Components:** Header → 3 testimonials with specific results

```
What others are saying:

"I went from 0 to 3 clients in my first month."
— Sarah Chen, AI Strategy Consultant
   Result: $34,500 in new revenue

"Closed $18K while on vacation."
— Marcus Johnson, Data Consultant
   Result: 2.3x pipeline in 60 days
```

### 6. TRANSFORMATION
**Job:** Make outcome tangible

**Components:** Quick win → Compound → Advantage → 10x

```
Here's what happens when you implement this:

WEEK 1: Quick Win
→ Send first outreach, book 2-3 calls

MONTH 1: Compound Effect
→ Pipeline fills, stop saying yes to bad clients

MONTH 3: Unfair Advantage
→ Referrals unprompted, clients pre-sold

YEAR 1: 10x Outcome
→ 3x revenue, waitlist for services
```

### 7. SECONDARY CTA
**Job:** Catch scroll-to-bottom visitors

**Components:** Avatar stack → Question headline → "Yes" button

```
[Avatar stack: 5-7 photos]
Join 2,847 consultants who already have the playbook

Ready to stop guessing and start growing?

[Yes, Send Me the Playbook]

```

### 8. FOOTER
**Job:** Professional legitimacy

**Components:** Logo → Navigation → Legal → Social

## SLIDE Alignment

| SLIDE | Section | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **S** - Situation | HERO | Headline sets the scene |
| **L** - Limitation | PROBLEM-AGITATE | Names the obstacle |
| **I** - Implication | PROBLEM-AGITATE | Agitation - cost of inaction |
| **D** - Destination | TRANSFORMATION | The after picture |
| **E** - Evidence | SOCIAL PROOF + VALUE STACK | Proof it works |

---

## Section Rules

### Every Section Must Have:
- Specific numbers (not "many" → "2,847")
- One clear job (not multiple objectives)
- Transition to next section (flow)
- Trust element where possible

### Hero Section:
- Eyebrow = credibility or category
- Headline = 10-15 words, primary promise
- Subheadline = how + de-risk
- CTA = benefit-focused (not "Submit")
- Trust = logos, numbers, credentials

### Value Stack:
- 4 tiers descending in value
- Assign dollar amounts to each
- Total must be 3x+ the price
- Create obvious "yes"

### Social Proof:
- Always include specific results
- Name + role + company
- Quantified outcome
- 3 testimonials minimum

### Transformation:
- Time-based progression
- Week 1 → Month 1 → Month 3 → Year 1
- Each stage builds on previous
- End with aspirational outcome
