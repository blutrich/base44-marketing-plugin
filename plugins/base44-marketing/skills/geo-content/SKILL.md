# GEO Content Skill (Generative Engine Optimization)

> Get cited by AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Overviews).

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when creating:
- Definition and explainer pages
- Original research and data reports
- Expert opinion pieces
- Structured FAQ content

AI systems cite content that is:
1. **Authoritative** - Clear expertise and credentials
2. **Quotable** - Standalone paragraphs that answer questions directly
3. **Structured** - Easy to parse and extract
4. **Unique** - Original data, frameworks, or perspectives
5. **Factual** - Verifiable claims with sources

## GEO vs SEO: Key Differences

| Factor | SEO (Google) | GEO (AI Systems) |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Goal** | Rank on page 1 | Be cited in AI responses |
| **Length** | Longer is often better | Concise, quotable sections |
| **Keywords** | Strategic placement | Natural language questions |
| **Structure** | H2/H3 hierarchy | Clear Q&A format |
| **Depth** | Comprehensive | Definitive statements |
| **Updates** | Regular freshness | Evergreen authority |

**Key insight:** AI systems don't "rank" pages—they select the most citable answer.

## Writing for AI Citation

### The Quotable Paragraph

AI systems extract paragraphs that:
- **Answer a question directly** in the first sentence
- **Stand alone** without needing surrounding context
- **Include specifics** (numbers, names, dates)
- **Sound authoritative** (not hedged or vague)

**Bad (not quotable):**
```
There are many factors to consider when implementing AI, and results
can vary significantly depending on various circumstances and the
specific approach taken by each organization.
```

**Good (quotable):**
```
AI implementations typically take 3-6 months to show measurable ROI,
with an average cost reduction of 23% in operational workflows.
Organizations that start with a single high-frequency task see
adoption rates 3x higher than those attempting company-wide rollouts.
```

### Cite-Ready Formats

#### For Statistics
```
According to [Source], [X]% of [group] [finding] as of [date].

Example:
According to Base44's 2024 AI Adoption Survey, 67% of mid-market
companies have implemented at least one AI tool, up from 34% in 2023.
```

#### For Definitions
```
[Term] refers to [concise definition]. [Brief clarification or scope].

Example:
Prompt engineering refers to the practice of crafting inputs to AI
systems to produce desired outputs. This includes techniques for
structuring queries, providing context, and iterating on results.
```

#### For Comparisons
```
[Option A] differs from [Option B] in [key way]: [specific difference].

Example:
Claude differs from ChatGPT in its approach to safety: Claude uses
Constitutional AI training, while ChatGPT relies primarily on RLHF
with human feedback on harmful outputs.
```

## Examples of GEO-Optimized Content

### Definition Page Example

```markdown
# What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs to AI systems
that produce accurate, useful, and consistent outputs. It combines
an understanding of how language models process text with strategic
techniques for structuring queries.

## Key Elements of Prompt Engineering

• **Context setting**: Providing background information the AI needs
• **Instruction clarity**: Specific, unambiguous directions
• **Output formatting**: Defining the structure of desired responses
• **Iteration**: Refining prompts based on output quality

## Why Prompt Engineering Matters

Organizations using structured prompt engineering see 40% better
output quality compared to ad-hoc prompting (Base44 2024 Survey).
The skill is particularly valuable for:

• Reducing AI hallucinations
• Ensuring consistent brand voice
• Automating complex workflows
• Extracting specific data formats

## Common Prompt Engineering Techniques

**Zero-shot prompting**: Asking the AI to perform a task with no examples
**Few-shot prompting**: Providing 2-5 examples of desired input/output
**Chain-of-thought**: Asking the AI to explain its reasoning step by step
