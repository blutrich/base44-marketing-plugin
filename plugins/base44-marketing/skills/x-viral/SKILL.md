# X (Twitter) Viral Skill

> Optimize content for X algorithm and engagement patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when creating:
- Single tweets (280 characters max)
- Threads (numbered sequences)
- Quote tweets
- Reply strategies
- Profile optimization content

## Core Philosophy

X rewards:
1. **Early engagement** - Likes, replies, retweets in first 30-60 minutes
2. **Conversation** - Back-and-forth replies
3. **Dwell time** - People stop to read/watch
4. **Native content** - No external links in main tweet

X punishes:
1. External links in first tweet (kills reach 30-50%)
2. Engagement bait ("Like if you agree")
3. Over-posting (more than 3-5x/day)
4. Editing tweets within first hour

## The X Content Mix (30/30/25/15)

For founders and builders:

| Content Type | % | Purpose | Example |
|--------------|---|---------|---------|
| **Hot takes & insights** | 30% | Drive engagement, show expertise | Industry observations, predictions |
| **Value threads** | 30% | Establish authority | How-tos, frameworks, breakdowns |
| **Personal stories** | 25% | Build connection | Wins, failures, lessons |
| **Promotional** | 15% | Convert followers | Product, launches, CTAs |

**Rule:** Earn engagement through value before promoting.

## Hook Patterns (First Tweet / First Line)

The hook must stop the scroll. X shows the first ~100-140 characters prominently.

### Pattern 1: Bold Claim
```
I can tell if your startup will fail in 30 seconds.

Here's the test:
```

### Pattern 2: Contrarian Take
```
Hot take: Most AI tools are making you slower, not faster.

Here's why 👇
```

### Pattern 3: Curiosity Gap
```
We just hit $1M ARR.

But here's what nobody tells you about this milestone:
```

### Pattern 4: Story Opening
```
I got rejected 47 times before my first yes.

What changed everything:
```

### Pattern 5: Unexpected Number
```
I analyzed 500 viral tweets.

The pattern was obvious once I saw it:
```

### Pattern 6: Direct Challenge
```
If you're still doing [X], you're wasting time.

Here's what top performers do instead:
```

### Pattern 7: Intrigue Hook
```
The results were honestly shocking.

We tried something crazy and it worked:
```

### Pattern 8: Question Hook
```
Why do 90% of no-code apps fail in the first month?

It's not what you think:
```

## Tweet Structures

### Single Tweet (280 chars max)

```
[Hook - punchy claim or observation]

[1-2 line proof or detail]

[CTA or reaction prompt]
```

### Thread Structure (4-12 tweets)

```
Tweet 1: [Hook - big claim + "Here's the breakdown:" or "Thread 👇"]

Tweet 2: [Context - why this matters]

Tweets 3-N: [Content - numbered points or story beats]

Final Tweet: [Summary + CTA + "Follow @handle for more"]
```

### Story Thread

```
Tweet 1: [Dramatic hook - the outcome or conflict]

Tweet 2: [The setup - where it started]

Tweets 3-5: [The journey - what happened]

Tweet 6: [The turning point]

Tweet 7: [The resolution + lesson]

Tweet 8: [CTA]
```

### Framework Thread

```
Tweet 1: [Problem + promise: "Here's my X-step framework:"]

Tweet 2: Step 1 - [Action + why it works]

Tweet 3: Step 2 - [Action + why it works]

Tweet 4: Step 3 - [Action + why it works]

Tweet 5: [Common mistakes to avoid]

Tweet 6: [Where to start + CTA]
```

## Formatting Rules

### Character Limits
- Single tweet: 280 characters
- Thread tweets: Keep each under 280
- Optimal single tweet: 100-200 characters (more engagement)

### Line Breaks
- Use line breaks liberally
- One idea per line
- White space = readability

### Visual Hierarchy
```
Use:
→ Arrows for lists
• Bullets for options
— Dashes for asides
CAPS for emphasis (sparingly)
Numbers for sequences (1., 2., 3.)
```

### Emoji Strategy
- 1-3 per tweet maximum
- Approved: 🧵👇🔥💪🚀🎉🤯✨💡📈
- Use 🧵 or 👇 to signal threads
- Don't use as bullet points (looks spammy)

### Avoid
- External links in first tweet (put in reply)
- More than 2 hashtags
- @mentions (DM instead or reply after)
- Walls of text without breaks

---

## Thread Best Practices

### Opening Tweet Requirements
1. Must stand alone (people see it first)
2. Creates curiosity or makes a bold claim
3. Signals thread with "🧵" or "Thread:" or "👇"
4. No links (save for last tweet or reply)

### Middle Tweets
- Number them (3/, 4/, etc.) for easy following
- Each tweet should deliver value alone
- Use callbacks ("Remember point 2?")
- Vary lengths (short punchy + longer detail)

### Closing Tweet
- Summarize key insight
- Clear CTA
- "Follow @handle for more [topic]"
- Can include link here

### Thread Length
| Type | Tweets | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| Quick hit | 3-5 | Single insight, hot take |
| Standard | 6-10 | Framework, story, breakdown |
| Deep dive | 10-15 | Comprehensive guide |

## Quote Tweet Strategy

### When to Quote Tweet
- Adding unique perspective to someone else's point
- Disagreeing respectfully with reasoning
- Amplifying content with personal experience
- Turning someone's question into content

### Quote Tweet Structure
```
[Your take or addition]

[Why it matters or what's missing]

[Optional: question for engagement]
```

### Quote Tweet Don'ts
- Don't just say "This" or "So true"
- Don't quote without adding value
- Don't use to argue (reply instead)

---

## Reply Strategy

### Replies That Build Followers
1. **Add value** - Share relevant experience
2. **Ask thoughtful questions** - Not generic
3. **Respectfully disagree** - With reasoning
4. **Share resources** - Links in replies are fine

### Reply Structure
```
[Acknowledge their point briefly]

[Add your unique perspective or data]

[Question or call to continue conversation]
```

### Accounts to Reply To
- Your ideal customers/audience
- Larger accounts in your space
- Trending topics in your niche
- Complementary products/services

---

## Algorithm Tips

### First Hour Critical
- Post when your audience is online
- Reply to every comment quickly
- Like and engage with responses
- Don't edit the tweet

### Boost Signals
- Replies > Likes (conversation wins)
- Bookmarks indicate high value
- Retweets extend reach
- Profile clicks = curiosity generated

### Posting Schedule

**Best Times (General):**
- Weekdays: 8-10am, 12-1pm, 5-7pm
- Weekends: 9-11am
- Avoid: Late night, early morning

**Frequency:**
- Minimum: 1-2x/day for growth
- Optimal: 3-5x/day
- Threads: 1-2x/week

**Pattern:**
```
Morning: Insight or hot take
Midday: Thread or value content
Evening: Engagement (replies, QTs)
```

---

## Hashtag Strategy

- Use 0-2 hashtags (often 0 performs better)
- If using: 1 broad (#AI), 1 niche (#NoCode)
- Don't put hashtags mid-sentence
- Only relevant, non-spammy tags

---

## Metrics That Matter

### Engagement Rate
- Good: 2-5%
- Great: 5-10%
- Viral: 10%+

### Profile Clicks
High profile clicks = curiosity generated = good hooks

### Bookmark Rate
Bookmarks = high-value content worth saving

### Reply Ratio
More replies than likes = conversation content (best for growth)

## X Voice Adjustments (Base44)

Compared to LinkedIn:
- **More casual** - Contractions, fragments OK
- **Punchier** - Shorter sentences, snappier delivery
- **More playful** - Teasing, bold claims OK
- **Less structured** - Don't need full frameworks every time

Approved phrases for X:
- "The results were honestly shocking"
- "Here's what happened:"
- "Nobody's talking about this"
- "This took us way too long to figure out"
- "🧵 Thread:"

## Integration

**Depends on:** brand-voice (apply voice), direct-response-copy (for CTAs)
**Used by:** Content calendar, automation workflows
**Layer:** Platform layer - HOW to format for X specifically
