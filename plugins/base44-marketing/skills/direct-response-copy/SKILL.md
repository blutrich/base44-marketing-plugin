# Direct Response Copy Skill

> Write copy that converts using THE SLIDE framework and SO WHAT chain.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when writing:
- Landing pages
- Sales emails
- Ad copy (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn)
- Product descriptions
- Lead magnet pitches
- Webinar/event registration pages
- Pricing pages

## Core Philosophy

**Direct response = measurable action.** Every piece of copy should drive a specific, trackable behavior.

Two key frameworks:
1. **THE SLIDE** - Structure for persuasive copy
2. **SO WHAT Chain** - Transform features into emotional benefits

---

## THE SLIDE Framework

### S - Situation (Set the Scene)
Paint the reader's current reality. Make them nod and think "that's me."

```
You've tried 5 different AI tools this month.
Each one promised to "transform your workflow."
Each one is now collecting dust.
```

### L - Limitation (What's Holding Them Back)
Name the obstacle. Be specific. Quantify if possible.

```
The problem? These tools solve problems you don't have.
87% of AI implementations fail in the first 90 days.
Not because the tech is bad. Because nobody asked: "What's actually slowing you down?"
```

### I - Implication (Cost of Not Acting)
Make the pain vivid. What happens if they don't solve this?

```
Every week you wait:
- 6 hours lost to manual tasks your competitor automated
- $2,400 in team productivity down the drain
- Another "AI initiative" your board will ask about
```

### D - Destination (Where They Want to Be)
Paint the after picture. Be specific about outcomes.

```
Imagine: Your team actually uses the AI tools you bought.
Not because you mandated it. Because they save 8 hours/week.
Your CFO stops asking "what's the ROI on that AI spend?"
Because it's obvious.
```

### E - Evidence (Proof It Works)
Show, don't tell. Use specifics.

```
This isn't theory. In the last 6 months:
- 23 companies implemented this approach
- Average time-to-value: 14 days (not 6 months)
- 91% of users still active after 90 days

"We went from 0 to fully adopted in 3 weeks. I've never seen anything like it."
— Sarah Chen, VP Ops at Acme Corp
```

## SO WHAT Chain

Start with feature, keep asking "so what?" until you hit emotion.

```
Feature: "Our AI analyzes 10,000 documents per hour"
    ↓ So what?
Functional: "You can review contracts in minutes, not days"
    ↓ So what?
Financial: "Close deals 40% faster, add $2M to pipeline"
    ↓ So what?
Emotional: "Your CEO stops asking why legal is the bottleneck"
           "You become the person who fixed the problem everyone complained about"
           "You go home on time instead of reviewing contracts at 11pm"
```

**Rule: START your copy from the emotional benefit, then work backwards to prove it.**

### Emotional Triggers by Audience

| Audience | Primary Emotion | Copy Angle |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Founders | Fear of failure, legacy | "Build something that lasts" |
| VPs | Career advancement, recognition | "Be the one who solved it" |
| ICs | Autonomy, mastery, less tedium | "Stop doing the boring parts" |
| Enterprise | Risk mitigation, CYA | "De-risk the decision" |

---

## Headline Formula

The headline does 80% of the work. Use these patterns:

### Number + Outcome + Timeframe
```
"How 23 Companies Cut Contract Review Time by 80% in 14 Days"
"The 3-Step System That Generated $47,329 in 90 Days"
```

### Problem + Unexpected Solution
```
"Why Your AI Tools Fail (And What a 5-Minute Audit Reveals)"
"The $12,000 Mistake I Made With AI (So You Don't Have To)"
```

### Specific Result + Skepticism Hook
```
"We Increased Demo Bookings 340%. Here's the Ugly Truth About How."
"I Deleted 23 AI Tools. These 4 Survived."
```

### Direct Question
```
"What If Your Team Actually Used the AI You Bought?"
"Ready to Stop Being the Contract Bottleneck?"
```

---

## CTA (Call-to-Action) Rules

### Benefit-Focused, Not Action-Focused

| Bad CTA | Good CTA |
|---------|----------|
| "Submit" | "Get My Free Audit" |
| "Sign Up" | "Start Saving 8 Hours/Week" |
| "Learn More" | "See How Acme Cut Costs 40%" |
| "Download" | "Get the Playbook" |
| "Contact Us" | "Book Your Strategy Call" |

### Reduce Friction
- Add "Free" if it's free
- Add time commitment: "15-minute call"
- Add no-commitment: "No credit card required"
- Add social proof near CTA: "Join 2,847 companies"

---

## Copy Length Guidelines

| Format | Length | Key Focus |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| LinkedIn Ad | 125 chars | Hook + single benefit |
| Google Ad | 90 chars headline | Keyword + outcome |
| Email Subject | 40 chars | Curiosity or specificity |
| Landing Page Hero | 10-15 words | One clear promise |
| Sales Email | 150-200 words | One ask, one reason |
| Long-form Sales | 1500-3000 words | Full SLIDE sequence |

---

## Power Words to Use

### Urgency (use sparingly)
```
Now, Today, Limited, Only, Before, Deadline, Last chance
```

### Exclusivity
```
Secret, Insider, Private, Invitation, Members-only
```

### Specificity
```
Exactly, Step-by-step, Complete, Proven, Blueprint, System
```

### Safety
```
Guaranteed, Risk-free, Refund, No obligation, Cancel anytime
```

### Results
```
Results, Transform, Achieve, Unlock, Discover, Breakthrough
```

## Example: Full SLIDE Landing Page

```
[HEADLINE]
What If Your Team Actually Used the AI You Bought?

[SITUATION]
You've invested in AI tools. Your team... hasn't.
The dashboards are empty. The licenses are unused.
Sound familiar?

[LIMITATION]
Here's why: Most AI implementations start with the tool, not the problem.
87% fail in the first 90 days. Not because AI doesn't work.
Because nobody asked your team: "What's actually slowing you down?"

[IMPLICATION]
Every week this continues:
- 6+ hours lost to tasks that should be automated
- $2,400 in wasted productivity per employee
- Your credibility takes another hit

[DESTINATION]
Imagine instead:
- Your team requests MORE AI tools (because the first ones worked)
- Your CFO cites your project as "the ROI example"
- You're known as the person who made AI actually work here

[EVIDENCE]
This isn't theory. In 6 months:
- 23 companies used this approach
- 91% user adoption after 90 days
- Average ROI: 340% in year one

"We went from 0 to fully adopted in 3 weeks." — Sarah Chen, VP Ops
