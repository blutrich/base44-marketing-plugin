## When to use

Apply when writing Remotion code for video compositions, animations, or rendering.

## Base44 Brand Integration

**ALWAYS** load brand assets before creating videos for Base44:

1. **Read brand file first:** [rules/base44-brand.md](rules/base44-brand.md)
2. **Apply brand colors** from the Base44 palette (warm orange accents on light gradient)
3. **Use brand fonts** (STKMiso for headings, Inter for body)
4. **Follow voice guidelines** for any text in videos (builders not users, ship not deploy, etc.)
5. **Avoid anti-patterns** (no arrows →, natural flow, short punchy text)

This ensures all video content is on-brand and consistent with Base44's visual identity and tone of voice.
