# LinkedIn Viral Skill

> Optimize content for LinkedIn algorithm and engagement patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when creating:
- LinkedIn posts (text, carousel, polls)
- LinkedIn articles
- Comment strategies
- Profile optimization content
- LinkedIn newsletter content

## Core Philosophy

LinkedIn rewards:
1. **Dwell time** - People stop scrolling and read
2. **Early engagement** - Comments in first 60 minutes
3. **Conversation** - Back-and-forth in comments
4. **Saves** - Content worth returning to

LinkedIn punishes:
1. External links (kills reach by 50%+)
2. Engagement bait ("Like if you agree")
3. Rapid posting (more than 1-2x/day)
4. Editing posts within first hour

## The Founder Marketing Mix (40/30/20/10)

For founders and consultants:

| Content Type | % | Purpose | Example |
|--------------|---|---------|---------|
| **Personal stories** | 40% | Build trust, show humanity | Failures, lessons, journey |
| **Industry insights** | 30% | Establish expertise | Trends, analysis, predictions |
| **How-to/tactical** | 20% | Provide value | Frameworks, templates, guides |
| **Promotional** | 10% | Convert followers | Offers, launches, CTAs |

**Rule:** Earn the right to promote by providing value first.

## Hook Patterns (First 2 Lines)

The hook must stop the scroll. LinkedIn shows ~2 lines before "see more."

### Pattern 1: Unexpected Number
```
I spent $12,000 on AI tools last year.
$9,200 was wasted.
```

### Pattern 2: Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion: Your AI strategy doesn't need more tools.
It needs fewer.
```

### Pattern 3: Story Opening
```
3 years ago, I got fired.
Best thing that ever happened to me.
```

### Pattern 4: Curiosity Gap
```
The #1 reason AI implementations fail has nothing to do with the technology.
It's this:
```

### Pattern 5: Direct Challenge
```
If you're still doing [common thing], you're leaving money on the table.
Here's what the top 1% do instead:
```

### Pattern 6: Specific Result
```
We increased demo bookings by 340%.
Not with ads. Not with cold email.
With one simple change:
```

### Pattern 7: Bold Claim
```
I can predict if your AI project will fail in 30 seconds.
Here's the test:
```

### Pattern 8: Relatable Frustration
```
I'm tired of AI tools that promise everything and deliver nothing.
You probably are too.
```

## Post Structures

### Structure 1: Story → Lesson → Takeaway

```
[Hook: Something happened]

[2-3 short paragraphs telling the story]

[Single lesson learned]

[Actionable takeaway]

[Question to drive comments]
```

### Structure 2: Listicle

```
[Hook: Number + Promise]

Here's what I learned:

1. [Point] - [One-line explanation]
2. [Point] - [One-line explanation]
3. [Point] - [One-line explanation]
...

[Summary/CTA]

Which one resonates most?
```

### Structure 3: Framework/How-To

```
[Hook: Problem + Promise of solution]

Here's my [X]-step framework:

Step 1: [Action]
→ [Why it matters]

Step 2: [Action]
→ [Why it matters]

Step 3: [Action]
→ [Why it matters]

[Where to start]
```

### Structure 4: Hot Take

```
[Controversial statement]

[Line break]

Here's why:

[3-4 supporting points]

[Acknowledge other side]

[Restate position]

Agree or disagree?
```

### Structure 5: Before/After

```
[Hook: Transformation promise]

BEFORE:
- [Pain point 1]
- [Pain point 2]
- [Pain point 3]

AFTER:
- [Result 1]
- [Result 2]
- [Result 3]

The difference? [Single insight]

[Question or CTA]
```

## Formatting Rules

### Line Breaks
- One idea per line
- Use line breaks liberally
- Never write walls of text

### Length Sweet Spots
| Type | Characters | Lines |
|------|------------|-------|
| Short punch | 300-600 | 8-12 |
| Story post | 800-1200 | 15-25 |
| Deep dive | 1500-2000 | 25-35 |

### Visual Hierarchy
```
Use:
→ Arrows for lists
• Bullets for options
— Dashes for asides
CAPS for emphasis (sparingly)
"Quotes" for dialogue or key phrases
```

### Avoid
- Hashtags in body (put 3-5 at end only)
- Emojis as bullets (looks spammy)
- External links (add in comments if needed)
- @mentions in post (DM them instead)

---

## Comment Strategy

### First Comment (Post Immediately)
Add context, a resource, or a question:
```
"If you want the full framework I mentioned, drop a comment and I'll send it."
"Curious: what's YOUR biggest challenge with [topic]?"
```

### Engaging Comments
Reply to every comment in first 2 hours. Ask follow-up questions:
```
"Great point! What made you realize that?"
"Interesting - have you tried [alternative approach]?"
```

### Comment on Others
Comment on posts from:
- Your ideal clients
- Industry peers (larger accounts)
- Thought leaders in your space

Rule: Add value, don't self-promote. Be known before you sell.

## Carousel Guidelines

### When to Use Carousels
- Step-by-step tutorials
- List posts (5+ items)
- Comparison breakdowns
- Story with visuals
- Data/research findings

### Carousel Structure
```
Slide 1: Hook (make them swipe)
Slide 2: Problem/context
Slides 3-8: Core content (one idea per slide)
Slide 9: Summary/key takeaway
Slide 10: CTA + follow prompt
```

### Design Rules
- Dark text on light background
- Large, readable fonts (24pt+)
- One main point per slide
- Consistent branding
- Include your name/handle on each slide

---

## Posting Schedule

### Best Times (General)
- Tuesday-Thursday: 8-10am local time
- Avoid: Weekends, Monday mornings, Friday afternoons

### Frequency
- Minimum: 3x/week for growth
- Optimal: 5x/week (weekdays)
- Maximum: 1-2x/day (more hurts reach)

### Content Calendar Pattern
```
Monday: Industry insight or prediction
Tuesday: Personal story or lesson
Wednesday: How-to or framework
Thursday: Controversial take or debate
Friday: Lighter content or reflection
```

---

## Hashtag Strategy

- Use 3-5 hashtags maximum
- Place at end of post
- Mix of sizes:
  - 1 large (1M+ followers): #AI #Marketing
  - 2 medium (100K-1M): #AIStrategy #B2BMarketing
  - 1-2 niche (10K-100K): #AIConsulting #MarketingAutomation

---

## Metrics That Matter

### Engagement Rate
Good: 2-5% (reactions + comments / impressions)
Great: 5-10%
Viral: 10%+

### Follower Growth
Healthy: 1-2% weekly growth
Strong: 3-5% weekly growth

### Content Performance Indicators
- Comments > Reactions (conversation wins)
- Saves indicate high-value content
- Shares extend reach significantly
- Profile views = curiosity generated
